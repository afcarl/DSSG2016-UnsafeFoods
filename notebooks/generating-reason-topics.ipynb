    "There are many possible reasons for recall according to our FDA datasets. While foodborne pathogens such as E. Coli and Listeria are among the common reasons, there are also labelling issues, such as undeclared ingedients, and other reasons for recall, with varying degrees of danger to consumers. In the FDA recall data, reason for recall is recorded in detail. However, it is an unstructured text field. Therefore, it is difficult to aggregate the recall data and provide summary statistics or connect this feature to the review data. Moreover, the reviews corresponding to different recalls vary in vocabulary according to reason for recall sometimes. For example, if someone is allergic to peanuts, and the product does not declare that it contains peanuts, the consumer explains this in their review with different vocabulary from someone who writes that they got sick for other reasons. Therefore, it is worth exploring this aspect of the recall data, as it could be included as a feature in our predictive classification model."

This is a document-term matrix that stores counts of each term, or token, within each document. This matrix is used to determine relative distance between documents and thus how related they are to each other and how they should be clustered. In many text mining situations, you want to remove sparse terms- that is, terms that don't appear in the corpus (collection of documents) more than n times (n can be 5, 10 or another low number depending on the corpus). This is one aspect of the topic modeling that we need to investigate that relies heavily on the nature of the corpus, in order to optimize the generated topics for our purposes."

This would be done by subsetting the preprocessed Document Term Matrix to only include columns representing topic-specific terms. The subset matrix would then be multiplied with the pseudo-inverse of the topic-term matrix to output a Document Topic Matrix. We would then run our classification models against this updated topic-review matrix to see if we can find patterns useful for a predictive model."

After TF-IDF weighting of the reviews' Document Term Matrix and removal of sparse terms, there was no overlap. Because of this, the topic data will have to be left for future experimentation."
