I knew i hadnt so i did some investigating & to my horror i discovered a 5 star review with my name on it raving about how good they are! but that review was intended for & posted under another flavor bar! (I posted it a while ago for the cherry dark chocolate trail mix bars  which are really good. Also the chocolate peanut protein ones are good too)  All i can say is ACK!!!!!!  I hate that it looks like i am reccommending these nasty peanut butter ones because i am NOT. i hate them. the box i received sucked.  Ive never eaten something with so much peanut in it that had so little flavor.  Its like they used a magic machine to suck the flavor out of the peanuts.  I did eat half the box over the course of a few weeks  thinking that maybe they would grow on me.  But after just finishing another one i think i can say with certainty that the only thing growing is a cavity on my back molar.  (they are not tasty but they certainly are chewy.)  In my opinion they are not worth rotting your teeth out of your head for. and what a complete waste of calories too! I feel like i should go jogging again today. Anyway   i would have MUCH rather eaten those yummy pumpkin spice flax bars  which are a crucnhy variety & my favorite flavor.

I went through 2 boxes so far  and I plan to continue buying more in forseeble future.',)\n",
      "('The first thing that drew me to these was the terrific combination of dark chocolate  a coffee element  and almonds. I realize that not all tastes and/or ingredients one might like independently would necessarily taste great together  but I knew that the combination of these 3 ingredients could make magic happen. :)An ingredient profile is a great start  and includes the fact that for this product  the 3 stars of our show :) were not accompanied by crap (which is very important to me  especially given how I intended to use this product)  but the nutrition profile would make or break whether  and if so how much  I might end up eating these granola bars.The most surprising things (and positively so) about this products nutrition profile  in my opinion  are as follows --* Each bar is only 130 calories (and while that might be too low for anyone intending to use this product as a meal replacement  one could eat two of them and still be below what so many other snack bars and healthy snacks come in at  calorie-wise) (besides  one can always eat more of something that is low in calories  versus more readily cutting back on something that is high in calories [and especially if the higher calorie item does not involve much volume  or an otherwise satisfyingly full feeling after eating a cut back version of such]).* Calories are one thing  but its the breakdown of what those calories are comprised of  that makes the difference  for me -- and each of these granola bars has 6g of protein  4g of fiber (3g of which are insoluble)  1.5g of monounsaturated fat  only 0.5g of saturated fat  only 90mg of sodium  and what positively stunned me was that each bar has only 6g of sugar -- THAT is remarkable  and is of benefit not only in and of itself  but is so important to those who must pay special attention to their blood sugar  including those who contend with insulin resistance.Ingredients and nutrition are important  but taste ends up being a kind of trump card -- and  thankfully  these taste good!They have a texture that is kind of in between that of a thicker-textured rice cake (sort of)  and a rice krispie treat (albeit with noticeably less of the tack-like aspect found with [marshmallow glue -rendered] rice krispie treats).These granola bars dont feel heavy in the stomach (and yet can satisfy hunger) -- and what this lighter in the stomach aspect allows for  importantly  for my needs  is that these are one of the only foods that I can eat during a workout (sometimes  if I havent eaten enough before a workout  or otherwise push past what Id originally intended  activity-wise  and find that I need a few more calories  these fit the bill [and sometimes its just a bite or two  taken while mid-workout  but given the nutrient profile  it makes a difference (and keeps me from getting lightheaded  or otherwise not having enough energy to engage in physical activity)]).This product has now replaced what previously used to be the only granola bar I would eat (Nature Valley Oats n Honey Granola Bars). Additionally  a bonus  when compared to the Nature Valley granola bars  is that these Kashi bars dont crumble -- not only when eating them  but also with respect to their survivability when in a purse or gym bag -- the Kashi bars stay intact (whereas the Nature Valley granola bars would tend to get broken  and/or crumble [and could make for an annoying mess]).I now keep a few of these with me practically at all times  and eat them while on the go  when running errands  or when running late and needing something to bridge the gap until my next meal.All in all  I am so glad that the folks at Kashi came out with this product.',)\n",

However  if you want a crunchy  nutty  dark chocolate treat that makes you feel good after eating  you may want to try these.  They are low in sugar--only 6 gms--about the same as in a cup of Cheerios or Total.  The nutritionist said to think of sugar as poison--your body wants to eliminate sugar before fat  so stay low in sugar. I keep one of these bars in my purse when Im out doing errands in case I get hungry.  I love the dark chocolate chips and nutty crunch.

Maybe it was the picture on the front of the box  with the bar showing lots of chocolate and almonds and the little circle saying No High Fructose corn syrup.  Whatever it was  it worked  I bought a box.And the taste wasnt too bad.  Even for not being a coffee fan I thought that this bar had a good mix of flavors.  You could definitely taste the chocolate and the coffee flavor was tolerable.  I dont drink regular mochas so I cant compare the taste there  but it seems reasonable to me to think it would be similar.  The almonds  even though I could see them in the bar didnt have much of a taste though.  I think they were a bit over-powered by everything else.  And the oats were just texture and filler rather than being a large part of the taste.  They are chewy bars  like the box advertises  but not so chewy that it is hard to get through them.  Id say they are on par with regular granola bars and the texture that is portable yet easy to get through.Kashi has pretty decent ingredients.  This of course has their blend of different grains  almonds  corn flour  honey and some other things.  They used the honey and brown rice syrup as a sweetener with the chocolate  and there is some coffee extract included for that mocha flavor.  Altogether it makes a bar around 130 calories  which really isnt that bad compared to a lot of granola bars out there.  Protein is 6 grams and the fat content is 3.5 grams.  There arent many vitamins to speak of  but it does have fiber and a little bit of iron.  Sugars weighed in at 6 grams  which also isnt too bad compared to a lot of other bars.It did its job and filled me up for breakfast for a few hours.  Id have to say that after experiencing the whole box  I do want lunch a little earlier  but not much.  Perhaps pairing it with a piece of fruit would make a more filling breakfast  but as a snack this could stand just fine on its own.  Ill probably keep trying out the different flavors of these bars  and will eventually come back to this one.Review by M. Reynard 2012',)\n",

It had gotten to where I was buying several packages at a time whenever I could find it anywhere.I was amazed to find it here on Amazon  and for considerably less than Ive paid in stores in the past.  I love chili  and usually make 1-2 batches per month during the winter  and at least a batch every couple of months during the summer.Theres a recipe on the package  but I dont know anyone who actually follows it to the letter.  I suppose if youve never made chili before  its a good starting place.  You can then decide how you might want to modify it.I usually use half ground beef and half ground turkey (approx. a pound of each)  a chopped onion  a 28-oz can of redi-cut tomatoes  a small can of tomato paste  a small can of black beans  a small can of pinto beans; then  from the chili kit  I add the spice packet and the entire cayenne pepper packet.  They used to include a tiny bottle of tabasco sauce; they discontinued that in favor of the cayenne.  I like things a little spicy  and the amount of cayenne here makes for a low-medium burn level.Only occasionally do I find I need to use the masa flour.  Usually  my chili is thick enough without it.Finally  I top it with shredded colby-jack cheese  and serve it with cornbred muffins.  Were talking serious yum here.It makes amazing chili dogs  too.  And chili mac.  And chili cornbread casserole (thicken the chili a little  put it in a square baking dish  top with dollops of cornbread batter  bake at 350 until cornbread is puffed and starting to brown).Carroll Shelbys mix has just the right combination of spices to make the best tasting chili Ive ever had.

      "('Ive been eating chili made with this since I was a kid  so for me  this is how chili is supposed to taste.In my family  growing up  Mom did most of the cooking. Except tacos  chili and barbecue which my dad did. My dad  a bit of a racing fan  always got this kind of chili mix for chili. He would make it with chuck steak ground into thick meaty chunks  tomato sauce and use just a touch of the cayenne half the salt  a bit of the thickener  and the chili flavor packet. Mom would make corn bread to go with it. The chili was served topped with cheese and onions with a thick slice of cornbread on the side dripping with honey and butter. My brother and I both loved chili night.Skip forward to my adult years and my marriage  I explained to my husband one day that I wanted chili for dinner. He said we would get the things to make  and I told him Dad always made the chili. I dont know how to  so you have to make the chili. He replied that he didnt know how to make chili  so I explained to him how to make it and told him what kind of seasoning to get. The same sort Dad always got. Now its in boxes instead of brown bags  but it still tastes the same.We make it to our tastes  and both of us make the chili. If I make it  I saut&eacute; a large onion then put in a lb of ground turkey and brown it. Then I add a large can of tomato puree and a can of kidney beans  and mix in the full chili packet  put the salt aside for popcorn another night  a bit of the masa thickener  and a pinch of cayenne and let it simmer for an hour. When my husband makes it  he makes it with very lean ground beef  tomato sauce  kidney beans  chili packet and a bit more pepper than I use  sometimes adding bell peppers and onions in while its simmering. We usually serve it with tortillas on the side and topped with a sharp cheddar.And my teens love chili night as much as I did when I was younger.',)\n",

They always complain about the heat  but invariably eat more  and then want the recipe.I think the secret is keeping each ingredient in its own packet until you cook. The chili is seperate from the oregano is sepeperate from the cumin is separate from the red pepper is separate from the salt  each in their own packet. In the Carol Shelby competing product  it is just one spice packet you dump in. I think all the spices sitting next to each other begin to cancel each others flavors out on the shelf  whereas with Wicks they dont even meet up until your meat and onions have been sauteed.I have been using Wicks for 34 years  and every other chili mix Ive tried has always failed to live up to this high quality  consistent product that well deserves its fabulous reputation among those who know their chili.

I thought that the flavors would emerge and improve during cooking  but it cooked up the same way.  The dominant taste was a sharp  bitter  dry  almost burnt  very old and dusty flavor.  Cumin  oregano  garlic  onion  all the flavors that round out a typical chili seasoning blend were undetectable.  The heat level was perfect; I used half the red pepper packet and it was a true medium-hot level.  But the overwhelming flavor was not of warm  deep  rich  pleasant chili.  It tasted of something more akin to a library full of mildewy books that had burned  then had been ground up and added to dried chiles. I usually make chili with my own recipe and homemade New Mexico red chile sauce  but I also use and like a variety of chili seasoning packets and chili-starter sauces.  Ive never tasted chili that was so close to being inedible.I may have gotten a rare bad box  and Im giving it two stars instead of one to account for that possibility.  I bought this at my local Kroger  which routinely sells food past its sell-by date including meat  fish  and dairy--so I now carefully check the dates of everything I buy there.

      "('Everyone should drink more water  or so we are told. The problem is that water is plain and boring. It needs some flavor  and many companies have responded to this demand. O.N.E. Coconut water with splash of pink guava is one such product. It contains coconut water along with guava juice for a unique taste.I like the taste of coconut but I am only so- so on the flavor of guava. Still  I decided this drink was worth a try because as long as it emphasized the coconut  it would be fine. Unfortunately  this isnt the case. O.N.E Coconut Water with a splash of guava is misleading in its naming  because you taste more guava than anything. Even then  the taste is rather unexciting. Even lovers of the flavor of guava will likely find this product a letdown.Nutritionally  O.N.E. Coconut water is very good  with low calories and a large dose of vitamin C and electrolytes in each serving  and more potassium than a banana. The sugar content is a little higher than some would prefer  but it isnt too bad and  unlike other sweet drinks  you get a good deal of nutritional trade- off for the sugar. Each time I take a sip and feel dissatisfied  I keep reminding myself of the nutritional benefits.Along with the bland flavor profile  there is one other problem I have with this drink  and that is the packaging. It is sold in a small foil box  which is ordinarily not a problem  but there is no included straw. There is an opening at the top that must be pushed- in to open  but the manufacturer doesnt include a straw. Thus  you have to use a fork or some other device to forge an opening. Then  you must carve out just the right shape for drinking from the box OR have another glass handy in which to pour the liquid.I wanted to like this beverage but when all factors are considered  I must rate O.N.E. Coconut Water with a splash of guava as a below average product. The coconut flavor is masked by the guava  the taste is unexciting  and the packaging is flawed. Yes  you get a good deal of nutrition so the product isnt a complete bomb  but there are other  better tasting products on the market with equally good nutrition  better taste  and more sensible packaging.',)\n",

      "('My family has been adopting a raw foods diet for the last year  and one of the things we have been able to enjoy is eating young green coconuts.A young green coconut looks like a woody white cylinder with a point on the top of it.  In order to open it  you take a heavy cleaver type knife and you strike it in four sides around the point of the coconut.You then take off the top and inside you get anywhere from 1/4 to a full cup of coconut water- a clear sweet nectar with subtle coconut flavor.Drinking this type of juice is a delightful experience  however  it does take some work to get at and is not always convenient- until now.When I first saw the 11 oz aseptic container of O.N.E coconut water  I was not sure what to expect.  I know that I expected it to be flat tasting and probably nothing like I was used to from having fresh green coconut water.I was wrong.This coconut water might not be fresh and raw  but it is the closest thing to it that I have come across so far.The foil wrapped box has about a 5/8 opening (slanted square) that is covered with foil.  You peel that off and it forms a slight spout for easy pouring.It is best served cold  so I kept in the refrigerator.The water/juice inside is a slightly cloudy clear liquid which has the delightful taste of young green coconuts.  There is a refreshing coconut flavor that is not at all overwhelming  but just right.It has no added flavors or sugars to it  which is delightful.  It has only 60 calories which is also a nice feature.I have compared it to fresh coconut water  and although I do prefer raw fresh water  I am very happy with this as a substitute.I can say this  my family all fought to taste this stuff- so it made a big hit here.If you are into raw foods and need to have a beverage which is close to what you are used to and is not cooked to death and sweetened in a package to take on a picnic  trip  or even to work  this is definitely a great item to have handy.You might like it even if you are not into raw foods  but like the fragile coconut flavor in coconut water- you should give this a try.I do want to mention that this is NOT the kind of water that comes out of very dark brown dried coconuts- that tastes very different than young green coconuts.',)\n",

My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth  like the glass had soap in it still.  I didnt think it was that bad but the drink really didnt appeal to me.In the end  yes  this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.

      "('My parents  who were stationed on Guam during the Korean war years  raved for years about the cocoanut water which came from fresh  green cocoanuts.  Apparently on Guam  in the fifties  it was a treat to bring in a bunch of green cocoanuts to their Quonset hut  extract the liquid and mix it with other fruit juices for an island treat.  They never actually said so  but I think some of those juices might have been of the fermented variety.  Anyway  when I saw this product on Amazon  I immediately ordered a case.  I must say that drinking straight cocoanut water is an acquired taste.  Two of my teenaged daughters liked it better than sports drinks  and thought the exotic nature of it gave it cachet among the athletes on their various teams.  They are anxious for me to order more.My dad said that this beverage is not quite like the fresh cocoanut water he recalls from his Navy days on Guam  but that it is very close.  He  too  wants to stock it in his pantry.  He said that the water he remembers was a little more flavorful.  But he did say that they seldom drank it straight  so he may have a faulty memory.As for me  I found the taste of this water a little on the thin side.  I expected more of a true cocoanut flavor.  I did try mixing it with fresh-squeezed orange  lemon and lime juices and adding a little sugar -- I found that helped enormously.  But I hardly think thats the point.This beverage is wonderful for those who have already developed a taste for cocoanut water  as my dad says its very close to what can be found in Nature.  It is also a low-calorie  potassium-rich drink which might fit in very nicely with a sports or exercise regimen.  As for me  I might try a real green cocoanut and its liquid the next time Im on a desert island.  But I think I will leave this beverage for those who are sophisticated enough to truly appreciate it.',)\n",

In fact  it tastes like youre just drinking water... very plain.  It wasnt very sweet or flavorful. I may be a little harsh because Coconuts are near and dear to my heart  but I have to be honest and I think they could have done much better.  For those of you who love coconut milk  I would recommend buying young coconuts from your local Asian supermarket. You can open it up  drink fresh milk and even eat some fresh coconut meat.

There are few things on earth more thirst-quenching on a hot day.Since  for most of us  young coconuts are not readily available  coconut aficionados are happy theres ONE Coconut Water. Water is usually my preference for a portable drink---filtered water from your tap in a stainless bottle. But there are times when water isnt going to quite do the job.

Keep some in the fridge and on hot days like today slip a couple in your backpack on the way out the door. Coconut water is also very useful to have on hand in the winter--its great for when your child is sick and wont eat or drink.There is no sugar  its miles away from any sport drink out there  and my son thinks its a huge treat.

      "('Coconut water is the liquid inside an unopened coconut. It is not coconut milk  although there is often confusion about that. Coconut milk is made from the meat of the coconut after it is opened and the water poured out. Inside the coconut  the water is sterile and very benign to the human body - it has been safely used in emergencies as IV fluid! (Straight out of the coconut  that is  NOT from a Tetrapak.)Coconuts in general are very healthy items. In the South Pacific the coconut palm is called the tree of Life  because it provides so many things for a healthy life: food  water  shelter  medicine  etc. Coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils on the planet  but has been the victim of intense propaganda campaigns by corporate vegetable oil cartels and other evil critters.Coconut water tastes (to me) a bit like very watery  unsweetened tapioca  with just a hint of sourness. It is quite bland by itself  but mixes easily with fruit juices  etc. It has great health properties and is rapidly becoming popular with athletes as a superb isotonic drink  because it has great electrolyte and mineral properties  and is a natural food with no harmful side effects or hideous chemical garbage masquerading as food.Good organic coconut water is very hard to find  but there are many brands of non-organic like this one on the market. I checked out the package info and vendors web site  but could find only general information on coconut water and its benefits  nothing specific about this exact product - where and how it is grown and harvested  the quality of the land and processing  etc. That is not a good sign.For an item that is very health oriented  the only reasons I can see for hiding that information are pure marketing ignorance  or knowing that the truth would not paint a good picture. Rain forests are reportedly being cut down for coconut palm plantations  especially those dedicated to unhealthy corporate factory farming practices. It would be vital for a company to distance themselves from that kind of activity by using only properly grown plants on healthy  environmentally sound plantations  and making that a very prominent part of their marketing.It would also be vital to play up everything possible that points to a healthy product by specifically mentioning those things about this specific product  not just general properties. This company doesnt do any of that  so I can only assume that this product is not produced in a way they want me to know about. That is the kiss of death for a product in my eyes. Granted  I am fussier than most in this regard.Dont be misled by the 100% Natural marketing hype. That means virtually nothing. It is not a strict  legally defined standard  as is USDA Organic  for example. Virtually anything found in nature  i.e. toxic heavy metals  MSG (yes  it occurs in nature)  animal manure  etc.  can be considered natural and can legally be included in a product labeled 100% Natural. Granted  USDA organic standards are very weak as organic standards go (compared to say  Oregon Tilth)  but they are still better than nothing.While I love coconut and want to give this product 4 or 5 stars  the complete lack of honest information about its origins and processing make me VERY  VERY suspicious. Without more information about how safe/healthy the product actually is  I can only give it 3 stars and a serious caveat emptor. It is probably much better than any ordinary sports drinks  but there are too many unanswered questions to be sure. Ones health is not something to be treated lightly.UPDATE July 2009:After continued searching  I still have not been able to locate a consistent source of organic or Fair Trade coconut water. While the manufacturer of this coconut water still does not give out any real information about the growing  harvesting  or other relevant details of production  neither do any of their competitors.So far  this is still the best coconut water I have been able to find  and I continue to drink it  even with the questions I have.',)\n",

The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition  even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.

It hydrates the body better than water or sports drinks. I used it when I was sick. It helped me feel better a lot faster. The buy one case  get one case of cashew juice deal free is a great bargain.

For the record  its not sickeningly sweet and is claimed to have anti-cariogenic properties (I love the stuff). Dont downgrade a product because you dont know how to interpret whats printed on a label (let the negs begin).O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava is very refreshing when youre in need of an electrolyte boost and I agree with other reviewers that 8.5 ounces is insufficient for a fierce thirst; I hope O.N.E. has this flavor slated for 1-liter packaging. The flavor is exquisite  as is the color. This also makes a great base for a pink guava smoothie--blend with a frozen banana  coconut milk (canned is fine)  frozen pink guava pulp  and a sweetener of your choice (coconut sugar would be great). Delicious AND pretty! You could also  if you prefer a different liquid (such as yogurt or fruit juice)  freeze it in an ice cube tray and add to the other ingredients to thicken and chill your smoothie--its the kind of product you can get creative with if youre into playing in the kitchen.To sum it up  O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava does NOT contain added sugar  doesnt claim to be a juice  and is well worth trying  especially if you can find it on sale.

The handy straw allows you to neatly poke a hole through the foil seal for a no-spill drink...perfect for car rides or letting kids carry their drink around the house.  We also drink coconut water when we are ill  instead of Pedialyte or Gatorade (much more healthy).  The straw is a great way to get fussy toddlers to drink the fluids they need when theyre sick.I highly recommend coconut water.

No real sweetness from the coconut  no sourness from the guava.Overall  Not crazy about it.Now  I do have something positive to say about the container  it held up well  and its relatively easy to open  although Id add a ring to the aluminum foil-like pull tab.

Your electrolyte balance can be upset by dehydration  over-exertion or illness  and any athlete can tell you that thats dangerous. This would be a great drink to have on hand if you could only have fluids or couldnt keep solid food down. I think of it more as a supplement than a beverage because there isnt much taste to it  but it would be handy to keep in your locker at the gym or in your bag.

Because this seems very similar to the way I used to drink my Hi-C Juice when I was in grade school.  No straw here though  just a foil covered hole in which you peel off the foil to drink.Ingredients are as follows: Natural coconut water  pink guava puree  cane juice  vitamin c  and natural fruit flavor.  Not too bad  sounds good  you have to add vitamin c to give the drink a little zing otherwise it comes off too bland  and they at least admit to adding natural fruit flavor which if you read the FDA website doesnt really have to be that natural at all.  But all-in-all the ingredients list looks good.  One container is 8.5 ounces  one serving  and you have 78 calories  no fat  128mg of sodium  302mg potassium  18.8g of carbs  with .5g of that being fiber and 16.6g being sugar.  You also get 0.8g of protein and the added vitamin c gives 183% of your daily value.  Lets move on to taste:Serve cold  shake well  and open...tastes like coconut and guava.  I guess I should have expected that.  It feels fairly light on the tongue  not that oily mouth coating feel you get from regular coconut water.  O.N.E. claims they get the water form green coconuts before the meat forms  so that accounts for the lack of oils and fats.  So you get nice tropical flavor.  Like a really watered down pina colada.

Much of my cooking does not require paprika  but I keep three different kinds in my spice rack because each is an indispensable flavor for some dishes.This one is the sweetest grade of the eight Hungarian grades and is called K&uuml;l&ouml;nleges. I use it as a garnish mostly; typically over deviled or hard boiled eggs and occasionally over other types of egg dishes. At the other end of the Hungarian paprika spectrum is another of the three types I use. Its from the same brand and is called Er&#337;s in Hungarian (seeTraditional Hungarian Paprika - Hotfor a description.) Its much spicier. The final type of paprika I use is a Spanish grade called piment&oacute;n de la vera. This one is smoky and hot  and vastly different than the Hungarian grades. My favorite brand isLa Chinata Hot Smoked Paprika by La Tienda.About the weevils. There are two products in which you can expect the pesky things: rice and paprika. I suppose some of the Americanized brands of paprika are weevil free  but they also lack the deep flavors of Hungarian (or Spanish) brands  and most fall far short of this particular brand.

It was fine ground and of decent quality.The top has two openings: for faster and slower flow rate. I found them difficult to operate since they both had pretty stiff lids and for many occasions  opening those lids was a torture so I ended up removing the top all together and taking it by a spoon. I think It should have been designed better.About the taste: As I commented in the headline  it tastes sweeter compared to other paprika brands I used  it is okay but I can not say it has a prominent flavor so I am neutral about the taste  you may find that you need to put more paprika than the recipe asks for to get the same effect.It is a nice purchase especially when bought through the subscribe and save program (offering up to 20% from the list price) however as I said  I can not say it is outstanding and if you are a massive paprika user  like myself  this size may not be appropriate for your needs.',)\n",

      "('I started buying Skippy several years ago after reading a number of consumer reviews that gave it a top ranking. The one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds  who gave Skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its tastes and texture. In writing this review  I went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. Im taking the liberty of quoting from the CookingLightly website so far as its review of Creamy:The roasted peanuts on the ingredient list are evident in the heady aroma and balanced flavor. Testers thought this sample was a touch oily  but spread the best...Makes the perfect peanut butter sandwich  but can turn into a savory dressing when mixed with soy  vinegar  and crushed red pepper to serve over sugar snap peas  broccoli  or a stir-fry. For a sweet version  mix with honey and mayonnaise and use as a fruit salad dressing. Mix with chile paste with garlic (sambal oelek) or sriracha for an easy sauce for roast meats.This is my opinion  too  and while the above review was for the regular Creamy  it applies in my opinion to the reduced fat version just as well. I love this peanut butter. I know that Jif and Peter Pan are also often ranked highly  but Skippy is by far my preference.While I use it on sandwiches  I often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. It is so good in this role that I gave it to a diabetic friend. She uses it in lieu of orange juice if shes starting to feel hypoglycemic. The peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.I will note that some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of reduced fat peanut butter. They have two ASIC points:1. The process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.2. To compensate for any loss of taste  manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.My rating is based on taste and texture. Im not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue.',)\n",

This has a good amount of sugar and a good amount of fat.  I eat them because they are a great cheat treat.  When I eat well all day  I look forward to this soft but chewy bar that has real peanuts and what seems to be real chocolate (I detest bars that proclaim to have real chocolate but instead incorporate a fake chocolaty substance).What I like about this bar:1) The taste - Wow! For a granola bar the taste is phenomenal. The picture on the box does not lie.  You can see peanuts and oats and the chocolate topping tastes awesome.  The texture of the oats/nuts melds well with the oats and nuts.2) Portable and easy to pack - If you try to stay aware of your daily calorie intake  it is always great to have easy to carry snacks with their calories clearly labeled. Who has time to count out the exact number of pretzels that comprise 150 calories? That is part of the appeal of a granola bar. Youve got a 150 calorie food item that can be placed in a purse or coat pocket and you are out the door.3) The company has made a conscious effort to reduce packaging in order to reduce impact on the environment.  The box is made of 100% recycled materials.What is questionable about this bar:1) This is a snack/treat bar and nothing else - This is not a healthful nutrition bar. The product packaging does not necessarily say this is healthful. It does use the words organic goodness and boasts 9 grams of whole grains. These notations may make some think this is a really healthy treat. But its not. The bar has low fiber (2g) and pretty high sugar for a 150 calorie bar (11 grams).2)If you use snacks to hold you over  you probably should find a snack with at least 4 grams of fiber. The 2 gram bar is not going to tide you over very long.If you feed these to your kids  there is a good likelihood they will like them. They are pretty sweet.  But again with the sugar  what else are you giving your kids during the day? Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 3/4 teaspoons in this bar. With everything else your kids consume during the day  (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?)  the sugar in this bar may not be worth it to you. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day  I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which  on the low end  would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end.Summary:Natures Path has created a very tasty granola bar with quality ingredients. Props to the company for not saying this was a health or nutrition bar on the box. I am reviewing this as a treat bar and as a treat  it is a delicious option. If it were being reviewed for health  I would not be able to give it four stars as it has high sugar  high fat and low fiber.  Dont expect it to hold you over for hours but do expect it to satisfy your sweet tooth.These granola bars are made in the United States.',)\n",

The milk worked for my thai curry quite well  but I just wish it was a bit thicker. While this milk is not as thick as the Mae Ploy brand I have tried in the past  I feel better knowing it was organically grown and that this particular company does not use BPA in their cans for coconut milk  or several other of their products. If more companies jump on the bandwagon I will try more brands but until then I am sticking with Native Forest.Added Aug 15th 2011:I now see lots of negative reviews on this product due to sourcing from both Sri Lanka and Thailand. Reviewers have stated the poor quality watery ones are coming from Sri Lanka  which makes sense why I rated mine a 4 and liked mine  because mine were the Thailand kind that like other reviewers have stated  taste great. So be careful when ordering this product and make sure you get the Thailand kind! (will say this on the back of the label) As there is no way to know which Amazon is shipping out  it seems the best bet is to get them in a local store and check the back and get the good sourcing of coconut milk that will say Thailand.Added Oct 20th  2012:As commenters have posted as a response to my review  you are able to purchase a powder that you can mix with hot water if you wish to avoid cans at Wilderness Family Naturals website.Another option is the Tropical Traditions website shows how to make coconut milk with dried coconut at home. (They sell organic dried coconut on their website  so avoiding cans  less packaging  ethical sourcing) They sell quality coconut products  I have purchased many of their items.Added Aug 5th  2013:In the comments section on my review a user posted:I just called Native & Sons co and they said there is NO detected bpa OR bps in there cans..Good to know!Lastly  I read recently on someones blog that you can use the coconut cream concentrate found on the Tropical Traditions website to make coconut milk  that it is very cost effective. I have not ever tried this  however I add a bit to smoothies for my partner in the summer and he loves the taste. If I ever try these things out I will report back  however I just wanted to give ideas to folks who might see this if they do not want to go the canned milk route. :)Added Dec 8th  2013:If you havent seen the 2 star review by Erin Get Better Wellness  titled  Supply Shortage so Product Coming From Sri Lanka not Thailand from September 9  2011 she lists the response from this company about the difference in the Thailand and Sri Lanka coconut milks. While I encourage you to look at her review  this was the response below she got from the company. I am only adding here because its valuable information and most people might not look through all 230+  reviews and comments to find all this but the manufacturer comment credit goes to Erin with the direct quote below. Thanks for contacting the company! ^_^From the manufacturer:Thank you for writing. Due to worldwide surging demand for coconutmilk during its lean harvest season  our primary organic packer inThailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales. Therefore wehave added a trusted organic coconut facility in Sri Lanka as oursecondary supplier. Unfortunately  Sri Lanka uses a slightly differentprocessing method than Thailand does and the Sri Lankan product hasmore tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degreesF. This makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separatesfrom the liquid. Such separation is harmless and easily remedied byplacing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and thenstirring the contents thoroughly. We regret this inconvenience especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother creamier consistency of our Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. Whileall natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cooltemperatures  the Thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous. Facedwith lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconutseason  we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistenciesfrom two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at allduring this six month lean period. We are only shipping Thai sourcedcoconut milkas of right now  but distributors and stores may still have Sri Lankansourced product.Thank you for your patience and your understanding.Sincerely Joanna FreetEdward & Sons Trading Co.',)\n",

In addition  I prefer to buy organic whenever I can  not only for health reasons  but to support that type of agriculture. My search for BPA free coconut milk led me to Native Forest  which is the only brand I found which is both organic and comes in BPA free cans.If youve been buying the Thai Kitchen brand  youll find the Native Forest brand a bit of a change in terms of texture. Instead of having a chunky coconut cream layer on top and a watery white layer down below  the Native Forest brand is more evenly blended and has a much more creamy consistency right out of the can. This makes it better for cold dressings or sauces  or uses where you dont want a distinct separation between the chunky coconut cream and the thick liquid. I love to pour it over curry with rice noodles as a healthy and flavorful garnish.Because my local stores all charge an arm and a leg for this brand of coconut milk  I was delighted to find it available on Amazon with prime shipping. This is a great product  Ive been ordering it exclusively from Amazon for about six months  and Ive never had a problem  except for the time when one or two cans arrived with very mild dents in the side. It wasnt a big deal  I just use those cans first.I highly recommend this product.

It was thin and watery  not thick and creamy like the Thai Kitchen.I read the Amazon reviews and learned that coconut milk from Sri Lanka is thin and watery  while that which comes from Thailand is thick and creamy.  I checked the can.  Yup.  Sri Lanka.  The reviews are correct.The main reason I bought coconut milk from Amazon was that the price was a little cheaper buying it in bulk.

The woman I spoke to was an absolute brat  borderline rude  with excuse after excuse. Maybe she was tired of fielding complaints  but isnt that her job? I was so surprised because I have had such great conversations and learned so much from other small companies like that--like Nutiva (who I complained to about my leaking coconut oil and devleoped a great relationship with one of the representatives there who sent me a replacement even though I told him Amazon had already reembursed me. I just wanted to let them know about the problem.Her biggest excuse (among several side-stepping maneuvers) is that the sample sent to them did not match the product. To me this speaks VOLUMES about the lack of quality control at the company. Makes me wonder what is in those cans. So  Amazon and other poor consumers will have to suffer for Edward and Sons faulty business products until the Sri Lankan is used up in about another month or so.

It is not stated on the can along with  the claims of NON GMO  Kosher  USDA organic  Vegan  Gluten Free.  If it were indeed BPA free they would want to put it on the label with these other claims because it would boost sales.  So it is not BPA free.3) the expiration date is clearly marked on the bottom of each can as well as the case it comes in  mine reads this way: Best Before : 21 FEB 2013  under that it has a number of 05  I think that is where that person got the 07 from he missed the real date or it was rubbed off somehow.  It is hard to believe that all 24 got rubbed off.We all have different tastes  and unfortunately in a business this large there are mistakes  contact the company but please do not give negative reviews if you have not tasted the product at all.

They are a little harder now  many in the box are a bit flattened  and there arent any nice big puffs that the boxes used to have.  More importantly than that  the taste is different.  Instead of just the nice  lightly sweet flavor  there is now a strange aftertaste.  Probably chemicals  because that is what is in most processed foods.  Corn Pops never had that aftertaste more than 5 or 10 years ago.  So sad how even cereals have changed over the past decade and are becoming inedible.Im downgrading this review to 1 star.

I like that they have both fruit and leafy greens in this fruit pouch. My kids enjoy the taste and receive them as a special treat and when we are on the go. In fact  my kids enjoy them so much that they never last long as they often request two of them at one sitting. I actually tasted them myself and they have a pleasant light pear flavor and I can just ever so slightly taste the spinach. Aside from the flavor  it is convenient that these pouches fit nicely in my diaper bag and I have never had them leak despite being buried under the constantly shuffled contents of my diaper bag.The reason that I am not giving these pouches five stars is that one pouch contains 11 grams of sugar. I wish that they could cut the sugar a bit  especially because my kids often want more than one pouch at each sitting. Still  the pouch is filled with vitamin packed mango  pears and spinach and one pouch provides a full days recommended amount of Vitamin A and Vitamin C.

      "('OK  Thats probably an exaggeration  but lets do the math  and please correct me if I am wrong:The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides estimated energy requirements for infants based on the Institute of Medicine&#8217;s Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Based on these estimates  the average 10-month-old boy needs at least 793 calories  and 10-month-old girl requires 717 calories per day (Page 15).Fat: 1 gram = 9 caloriesProtein: 1 gram = 4 caloriesCarbohydrates: 1 gram = 4 caloriesThe 14 grams of sugar in this package provides 56 calories. 14 calories from fat and 4 calories from protein. Another 24 calories from the other 6 grams of carbohydrates. That is 98 calories. The package says 90  so thats about right.The World Health Organization just halved its recommendation from 10% to 5% calories from sugar per day. Thats added sugar  but juice counts as added sugar  so this baby food is effectively the same thing. So one package of this stuff  and youve got your daily limit already.What about fats and protein? They need about 10 grams of protein. Youd need 10 packs of these  which would provide 10 times the daily level of sugar.And forget about those essential fats needed for healthy brain development. You might just do better with Chocolate truffles! At least they have fats to go with the sugar.By the way  once you feed your baby these sweet packages  forget about developing a good sense of taste for non-sugary things. Think of this baby food as training for the sugar cereals the industrial giants will push to your kids next.',)\n",

My daughter has loved every variety weve tried  and weve found that this brand is less expensive than others (ie Plum or Ellas Kitchen as well as the brands marketed specifically for toddlers).While these look like &#34;baby food&#34; they work great for toddler snacks too!  Both our 9 month old and 2 year old have loved every variety weve tried  including those containing peas  broccoli  and spinach.  Youll find that the veggie is listed last on the ingredient list in these (apple or pear is usually the first ingredient) but thats ok with me.

      "('Since there is more fruit than veggies in these pouches  I like to mix in part of a pouch of vegetables when serving this. While the sweetness really isnt an issue for these fruit and veggie blends  I have found it helpful to mix it in with fruits or vegetables that the little one has disliked before  then the next time add more of the straight fruit or veg and less of the blend  and maybe once more repeat this with barely any of the blend. Its tempted him enough to keep giving the initially disliked fruit or vegetable a second chance  and by the third or fourth feeding when theres no more of the sweet blend like this mixed in  he usually is now gung-ho on a food he would only spit out before. This really worked with some of the more bitter/off-putting produce out there  such as broccoli  Brussels sprouts  and spinach. Ive sampled all of the foods Ive given to my child to make sure something isnt too sweet or too sour  and even though there isnt much produce I dont like  some of the single item baby foods out there are great examples of why someone would never want to eat that particular item. I suppose by mixing some of the sweeter/tastier blends in with the unappetizing one  its akin to people using butter  bacon  and/or cheese as grown-ups to make foods more palatable.And like another reviewer mentioned  any leftovers work great mixed into your dogs food (after verifying it wont cause any health problems for them). Our two senior dogs enjoy the additions  and theyve had no tummy issues either. If you dont have dogs  you can also freeze any leftovers you wont use in the next 24 hours. I use an ice cube tray  empty the pouch into it  and use the cubes for my smoothies later on  or even as a frozen treat for our dogs. Ive also added the leftovers into soups and sauces.',)\n",

Never realized what a pistachio really tasted like till these. Best of all  its just pistachios and salt  and not a bunch of other weird ingredients in there like you might find in flavored pistachios or in Costco pistachios  but they are just as flavorful.

Justins: 7 grams sugar  15 g fat  180 calories in one serving - 2 Tablespoons).I tried this for the first time in the summer of 2013 (after the recipe change apparently  mine contains almonds and hazelnuts) and I love it. This actually has a nuttier taste of hazelnuts plus the chocolate than Nutella does. It tastes more like the real foods and not bordering on a frosting taste. There is less sugar in Justins so it is not super sweet either.The only problem with the product stems from the unhealthy ingredients is lacks. The lack of processing it further to make it really creamy like a creamy peanut butter like Skippy or like Nutella is  is what keeps it healthier for our bodies. But  sometimes it separates or gets a thick clog on the bottom and it takes some stirring to mix it up and it is not always smooth like Skippy. I am sure you know what I mean. Now the good thing is that it is not really separating or thick and unstirrable like the product is when you grind your own nuts at the store for natural cashew butter or natural peanut butter. Justins Nut Butter is much smoother than that.I was tempted to downrate this to 4 stars based on it being not super smooth but I corrected my judgment because I rate health and better nutrition and less sugar as more important  so I rate this product 5 stars = I Love It.This is not an exact replica of Nutella.

I like this product so much  I even registered for Auto-Delivery as the price of three was so much less expensive than what my local health food store was offering.  Unfortunately  as with all good things  this tasty treat transformed into a product much less desirable in its present form.  Auto-Delivery was firmly cancelled and my pantry still houses two unopened jars of this awful mixture.Firstly  the company must have decided to change the formula and add almonds to the blend.  The hazelnut taste is usurped by this blander and less coveted flavor.  In addition  whatever blending process was once used  obviously has been abandoned.  The current product contains bits of shells that are nasty to feel on your tongue and between your teeth.  I am surprised that someone hasnt sued the company for a broken tooth.  The once wholesome grittiness of this product has been pushed to the limit--better to use it as an abrasive cleanser than to eat it.  Lastly  whatever oil used to sit on top of the jar in its second reincarnation has been leached away resulting in a grout consistency that just doesnt work.  At least with the oil  the product could have been mixed--although this was difficult in itself to maneuver  but at least some degree of smoothness resulted.Bottom line?  Justins Chocolate Hazelnut Nut Butter used to be a great product.  The company changed the formula and ruined the fact that they  indeed  had crafted a healthier brand of Nutella.  I guess they could not sustain the great quality and opted for something less tasty and less presentable in terms of consistency.

       " 'EASY OF USEIve used the Mellita Coffee System for about    years  I find the system more convenient than coffee machines   If the power goes off  you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove   It is easy to brew  exactly the amount of coffee you want  and exactly the strength that you want   including adjusting to new roast and grinds  You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish   In a way  the Mellita system is more sanitary  It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker  maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation  and find a fungus garden in there  You cant ignore a used Melitta filter  because it is out in the open  If you forget a used Melitta filter  it and the coffee grinds just dry out   It is also much easier to wash the Melitta components   just a quick rinse under the tap is usually good enough   Caveat  some types of coffee are oiler than others   you may need to actually wash your cone and carafe if a quick rinse is not sufficient SIZE OPTIONSThe carafes for which the   cup and    cup systems can nominally hold   or    cups off coffee  filled to the brim   but that is really irrelevant   A more important consideration is cups vs mugs   How many people still drink cups of coffee   So  it is the mug capacity    mug         cups  of the filters and cones which really counts    filters conesRecomemnded    cupPractical Maximum    mugTheoretical Maximum    cups   filters cones    cup system Recommended      mugsPractical Maximum         mugsTheoretical Maximum    mugs   filters cones     cup system Recommended      mugsPractical Maximum    mugsTheoretical Maximum    mugsHowever  I dont follow my own recommendation   In the morning  I want coffee now   I often run out of patience trying to brew even   mug of coffee using    filter cones   On the other hand  the    filter cones holds a whole mug of hot water in one quick pour  and drains about as fast as you can continue to pour the water in   so I find it very convenient for brewing   to   mugs of coffee at a time  and on rare occasions to easily brew   mugs    cups  of coffee   However  in this case  the hot water has little time to extract the flavor from the coffee   To compensate  I grind my coffee very finely   I could simply use more coffee  but that would be wasteful The    filters cones     cup system  is faster and more flexible  at a slightly higher cost for the filters Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker    Cup    CountIf you are patient and your space is very limited  such as in a camper  boat  or in a college dorm  or if you really want only   or   mugs of coffee at a time     filter cones  the so called   cup system  is a good choice GRINDS OF COFFEEIf you usually brew the recommended or fewer number of mugs of coffee  then very finely ground coffee is recommended  If you usually brew the the recommended or more number of mugs at a time  then a medium grind coffee may work best   Most supermarket fine grind is actually a medium grind   If you brew more than the practical maximum a medium coarse grind will work better   If you grind your own coffee in an electric grinder  coarse is only a second or two  medium fine is perhaps    seconds  and very fine is perhaps    seconds  until the pitch of the sound changes  indicating that no more grinding is taking place REUSEIf you use very fine grind  then discard the used filter when finished  because most of the flavor will be extracted  and the filter will be clogged up by the fine grinds    If you use a medium grind  then you can optionally reuse the grinds in the afternoon to make a second batch of coffee  which will be lower in caffeine    Coffee freaks may object to reusing grinds  but it works just fine FORMULARegardless of the grind  you have to use the same formula for the TOTAL amount of coffee actually made  i e     to   tablespoons of ground coffee per mug  depending on your taste  brand  etc FILTERSPresumably  brown filters are easier on the environment   and on you  less chemicals having been used to manufacture them   Unfortunately     filters are hard to find in most grocery stores  but easy to purchase via Amazon Melitta

Count Filters  Pack of    In an emergency  you can use    filters in a    cone  but youll regret it  having been spoiled by the convenience of    filters  RECOMMENDATIONS ON MAKING GOOD COFFEE  Use fresh unchlorinated water if possible   Do not use softened  sparkling  or mineral water   If you let an open pitcher of water sit on a counter for a few hours  or overnight   most of the chlorine will evaporate   The best way to get pure water is a reverse osmosis system   Bring the water to a quick boil  but dont leave it boiling too long  that will flush out the dissolved oxygen  leaving the coffee tasting flat   There is a huge difference between brands and roasts   Experiment and enjoy   However  even more important is freshness   which is the greatest challenge   How can you know if the coffee is fresh   The easiest way is to signup with a service such as Gavelia  Boca Java  or Coffee Bean Direct  whose only business is providing you with freshly roasted  and freshly ground if you wish  coffee   Particularly if you do not use a coffee service  its best to buy whole beans and grind them just before brewing   A     grinderKrups        Fast Touch Coffee Grinder  Blackis as good as a      grinder  It takes only a few seconds to grind a batch of coffee while waiting for the water to boil   For newbies  French or dark roast coffee is rich and bitter  and usually brewed strong   Light roasts are more complex  but some are acidic  and are usually brewed and drank more like tea   Light roast Indonesian coffee is particularly complex   Caveat  complex does not necessarily mean flavorful   some dark roasts are wonderful  but it is probably harder to find a good dark roast   TheCoffee Bean Direct Assorted Whole Bean Coffee Sampler    Pound Boxavailable from Amazon is a good way to explore the varieties of coffee   The filter cone and carafe should be rinsed off after every use  otherwise your coffee can be contaminated with stale oils  A weekly wash in the dishwasher wont hurt   Elsewhere  youll read endless nonsense about the exact water temperature  how fast or how slow to pour the water  the value of porcelain vs plastic cones  preheating the cones with hot water  how finely ground the coffee should be  etc   Its all nonsense  except possibly to engineers who design coffeemakers       of what matters is the quality of the ingredients  water and coffee   You want fresh oxygenated chlorine free salt free water  and good quality recently roasted and recently ground coffee SAFETYIt is easy to forget the glass carafe on a hot stove   I broke at least   carafes before I purchased a whistling teakettle Revere       Quart Whistling Tea KettleNEVER use the carafe to boil water or reheat coffee   The flood of water might crack a ceramic stovetop  or put out a the flame of a gas stove   both causing catastrophic problems   Use your microwave to reheat    mug of coffee         seconds   its faster and safer It is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter  not between the filter and the filter cone  It is any easy accident to make  To minimize such accidents  fold over the joined edges of the filters so that the filter opens wider  If you are a particular klutz  a quick rinse with a little cold water before you add the ground coffee can glue the filter to the cone SUGAR IN YOUR COFFEE Purist insist that coffee should always be drank black   While I tentatively agree  I cant   My taste buds are overly sensitive to bitterness   However  I have found that pure SteviaPure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal       ozis a good replacement for sugar for me   Oddly  it isnt as sweet as sugar  but is just as effective in cutting the bitterness  which is what I really need   Truvia and other brands in packets or described as spoonable contain bulking agents which effect the flavor and leave a yucky residue  and are comparatively expensive   KAL Pure Stevia contains no bulking agents and is very economical SALT IN YOUR COFFEE Its a naval tradition   Ive found that a few grains of sea salt in a cup of light roast coffee can be pleasant  but not so compelling that I make a habit of it   However  a little salt is more noticeable  in a good way  in ice coffee MILK IN YOUR COFFEE If the purpose is just to cut the acidity  then you need to try a different coffee or brewing method   If the purpose is to cut the bitterness  you might want to try stevia instead   If you simply like milk in your coffee   I say  indulge yourself with a little real  not fake  half and half  or even heavy cream   I usually drink my coffee black with a little stevia  but for a rare desert cup  real sugar and real cream are essential GENERAL SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONAfter major grocery shopping expeditions  sit down at your computer with your receipt  and check if you can buy any of the non perishables through Amazon  When you find items  even if more expensive than you just paid   put the item on your Amazon wish list
