"B0000537KC","Tastes great. A little sweet and lower in protein than Think Bars, but this bar is good!",5,"A Real Treat",1274918400,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","Updated review on 06/23/2013 which is now only 2 stars:OMG, why in the heck did they change their recipe? The chocolate fudge brownie bar that I once was addicted to is no more. What they now sell as ""Chocolate Fudge Brownie"" are so hard now, the bars can serve as a door stop or as another reviewer wrote, as a brick. Yes, and the taste has changed for the worst. Why did they change something that wasn't broken is beyond me. I still order these, but to be able to tolerate the taste, I put a Oskri Coconut Bar on top, cut the bars in half, and then eat the 2 bars together, but it's half of both to keep the caloric amount the same. I actually enjoy it this way, but still am disappointed by the hardness of the Genisoy bar. The Oskri Coconut Bar is so soft (and yummy) that it helps mask the hardness of the Genisoy Chocolate Fudge Brownie Bar.All I can say is ""Genisoy, please fire the idiot who convinced you that this new formula is better and go back to the old recipe to win back your faithful customers.""In comparison, I kept my old review so those of you who are wondering what we are talking about as far as this change is concerned can understand the issue better.Old Review from 2/10/2012 which was 5 stars: Title was ""I could become an addict""I went searching high and low for a replacement chocolate brownie bar when my taste for Clif chocolate brownie bar suddenly changed (I had no other taste changes for any other food and the manufacturer swore they made no changes). I bought one of every type of chocolate protein bar and literally Genisoy was the last one I had to taste. I've had Luna bars and don't like their taste at all. My first byte into the Genisoy chocolate brownie had an after taste of vitamins, but after the first bar, that taste was gone. It was delicious and I love the fudgey, soft texture. I had finally found my replacement protein chocolate bar after weeks of searching all the local organic markets.",2,"6/23/2013: Update to old review... What the heck were they thinking?!?!",1328832000,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","Genisoy bars are a great meal replacement.  They are more filling than any other bar we have tried.  I would highly recommend them to friends and family.  In fact my daughter has also started buying them.",5,"Great",1395014400,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","They are just delicious, and a great way to get in some protein if your day is turning out to be deficient in it.  A good emergency ration kind of thing.",5,"Love Genisoy bars!",1269561600,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","The bars arrived as plan and are very fresh. I will difinitely order this product again on Amazon. Thanks again.",5,"Excellent",1333929600,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","The Genisoy protein bars are thin, chewy protein bars. The chocolate fudge brownie is one of the best flavors from Genisoy. It does taste like soy but it is sweet enough to make you feel like you're eating a treat. The texture is similar to the original Power Bar but definitely tastes better.",5,"Great tasting protein bar",1297036800,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","bought these suckers a few months ago & have been hooked, love the taste & they're soy.by far this is my fav flavor.:)",5,"addicting!",1395014400,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","These bars are soooooooooooooo good I eat too many of them! Great for meal replacements or snacks. But be warned, they are addicting!",5,"Great",1402876800,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","I have no idea what all those people are saying but these bars don't taste that great...it is full of sugar and high fructose corn syrup. I much prefer luna bars or the south beach meal bars--which all taste tons better and are healthier.",2,"not that great",1169856000,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","I was excited to repurchased these bars after I took 2 years off from eating them. I have two children under 18 months old and was pregnant A LOT and the dr said to stay away from soy based products while pregnant. Anyway, when they arrived I was surprised that the packaging was different (not as shown here) and that the bar is a new recipe and shape. They are more square like a balance bar, a little less in calories (maybe by 10 or so) and the taste IS TERRIBLE!!! Almost the consistency of an Atkins bar or some other low carb tasting crap (even though these are not low carb) I only wish I read the one reviewer warning of this new taste before I bought these. What a waste of $13. :-(",1,"New recipe tastes like crap",1361404800,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","I used to really like this product.  It kept me from getting hungry for at least 6 hours.However, this shipment seems to be melted and stuck to the wrapper.  Even though it is edible,it makes a mess just getting it out of the wrapper.  Maybe that is why I could no longer findit in the grocery stores.",3,"not the same",1347494400,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","At one time these bars were my favorite.  Tasty and soft.  Now they are suitable to be used as paving stones.  I have purchased from three or four different Amazon suppliers.  Each time the result has been the same - hard and unpleasant to chew.  I have stopped purchasing the Genisoy Chocolate Fudge Brownies and now purchase and eat Cliff Bars exclusively.  A shame, but life goes on.  Even without you Genisoy.",2,"Goodbye old friend",1344729600,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","Pleasantly surprised how tasty these bars are!  They're chewy and moist and filling!  Love them and would definitely recommend them!",5,"Yummy!",1361491200,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","This used to be one of my favorite bars, but not any longer.  Earlier this year, think around the April 2012 time frame, they changed the ""model"" and made it a lot more ""hard"" and less tasty.  They used to be much softer and tastier.  In fact the last set of bars before they made this change were absolutely great and hence this change has been harder to take. Hope they change it back to what it used to be.",3,"Less good than before",1354406400,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","The bars are good, however seem to be very hard. Just a little too hard for my taste. They taste good and have good protein. I will try a different flavor next time I order. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys something very chewy.",3,"Very very chewy, and tastes good.",1356566400,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","The package was warm after being inside of a mail truck all day and thus the coating of chocolate melted.",4,"great product but difficult to purchase in the summer",1154476800,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","The reviewer below who states these have high fructose corn syrup is wrong.  I'm looking at the ingredients list for the Chocolate Fudge bar and it lists corn syrup, but not the notorious high fructose variety.  It's a good, tasty snack and a good way to get soy protein on the go.",5,"Great as a snack",1180915200,"2009-02-04"
"B0000537KC","Of all of the nutrition bars that I have tried the Genisoy Chocolate Fudge Brownie is right up there in the top 4.  It doesn't taste like a protein bar - it tastes almost like a candy bar.  When I have a chocolate craving this bar can really satisfy it.  Even my husband (who hates nutrition bars) likes these.",5,"love these bars",1168473600,"2009-02-04"
"B0000CEQD5","Like most people who buy organic peanut butter, I do so because peanuts are heavy in pesticides and I want to provide my family with a better quality option.  This peanut butter seemed great at first glance - but be careful and read the label.  Maranatha makes several types of organic nut butters -- but the ""no stir"" type contains sugar and palm oil.Granted, it's ""organic palm oil"", but the palm oil industry is guilty of horrific ecological atrocities, including the systematic genocide of endangered orangutans and decimation of rain forests. (If you google ""orangutans and palm oil"", it'll break your heart). And palm oil labeled ""green"" or ""organic"" is generally considered ""greenwashing"" - it's still grown in palm farms which have replaced vital rain forest -  so I'm skeptical.Plus palm oil is not so good for our health. I'm surprised that Maranatha would include it.Maranatha DOES makes a good quality, tasty organic peanut butter that is a better option than their ""no stir"" type.  It's delicious and has ""no additives, sweeteners, chemicals, preservatives or trans fats"" - and less ethical concerns too.  You can find it here on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/Maranatha-Pnut-Crmy-Salt-16-Ounce/dp/B00060N592/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1354476981&sr;=8-2&keywords;=maranatha+organic+peanut+butter",1,"Palm Oil",1354406400,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","You're not missing anything with this peanut butter. There's not much flavor to it, and you need to keep it in the fridge which will make it hard. It's ok if you plan on using it for apples or something. I got it locally for $6.I noticed there are ingredients missing on the image too. Mine has evaporated cane sugar and stuff in it.If you think you will get the goodness of Jif from this then you're looking in the wrong area.",3,"Not missing anything",1391904000,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","Bleck, this stuff is sickeningly sweet. I intended to buy the almond butter (trying to stay away from legumes) but grabbed the wrong jar. Oh well, it's certified organic, it must be good. No, this cavity inducing paste is at least as sweet as Skippy and Jif. But hey, that's marketing for you, right? Prefix every ingredient with organic and con the consumer into buying candy when they think they're buying something healthy. Also, palm oil? Really? Even if it is organic, that stuff wrecks you (and the societies and ecosystems from which it is extracted). If you need to eat peanut butter, then it should be in a jar with a label containing the following ingredient: peanuts. I will not be going back to the store to remedy my mistake by buying their almond butter, as my blood sugar levels are causing blurry vision due to eating a tablespoon of Mara Natha's peanut flavored sugar paste.",1,"This is candy, and not in a good way.",1380153600,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","Excellent Organic Peanut Butter! I agree with other reviewers, you should when FIRST OPEN JAR STIR IN CENTER SLOWLY, to let the oil on top seep down and mix properly.  Then you're good to go and enjoy Peanut butter & Jelly soft bread sandwiches. I'm getting the non salt version, though only 80 mg of sodium in this type, unlike alot of commercial brands that have 100 mg or more.",5,"Authentic Creamy Peanut Flavor!",1179964800,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","This product has a good taste, it is also fortunate that unlike other brands this seems to be the easiest to spread on toast after taking out of the fridge (though it still is not as easy as it should be and does require patience)",4,"Tastes good",1370217600,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","The taste is phenomenal.  My husband, who has disliked every organic peanut butter we've purchased, actually said this is the best PB he's ever tasted.  I only buy it for my kids.  I attempted to buy it on Amazon, but the description stated a pack of 6 for around $20 something.  I ordered it and received 1 jar for the over $20.  So, warning, don't believe the case packaging line (if it's still there in the advertising)  Why would anyone pay $20+ for a jar of PB?  It is available at local organic superstore for about seven dollars/jar.  Yes, costly, but so worth it!",5,"The best organic no stir peanut butter available",1375142400,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","When they say ""No Stir Creamy Peanut Butter"" they mean no stir! Great tasting peanut butter and there is no separation.",5,"Delicious",1352160000,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","In the weight control program that I follow, peanut butter is either a ""fat"" or a ""protein"".  With that in mind, I have tried different peanut butters and have narrowed my preferences down to two brands, Maranatha being one.  My reasons:-Organic: made with certified organic peanuts and if that is important to you, then Maranatha is a great choice.-Additives: NO hydrogenated oils, NO sugar added; no nothing except for a tiny trace of salt.  But, this does not taste salty at all-Great taste: This should have been first.  Maranatha has a mild, mellow, peanutty taste. I really do like it.-Great texture: truly smooth and creamy. Easy to spread even on soft breadHint: This is NOT homogenized; the oil is on the top of the peanut butter when you open the jar.  You have to mix it in but, fear not!  Stick a butter knife down into the middle of the jar and move it ever so slightly, creating an opening into which the oil can flow.  Repeat this a few times and most of the oil will be gone from the top.  Stir and then enjoy.  You will NOT have to mix again.Summary: A wonderful way to get those ""fat"" allowances from a healthful type of fat.  This peanut butter has made my weight control easier because I substitute it for far less satisfying fats and it seems as though I am eating something sinfully sensational.",5,"Marvelous Maranatha PB",1143849600,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","I also like the MaraNathra PB. But the no stir version is not what some of the reviews on hereare talking about. These reviews are supposed to be for the no stir version and some reviews on here are for the oil on top, stir it up, version of their peanut better. Not the same PB.",4,"reviews are mixed up, not for no stir version!",1360368000,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","I have tried them ALL - even making my own, which would be the best if I could get fresh organic peanuts. In lieu of that, I've been eating this p.b. for over four years. It's great with anything p.b. goes with, even better all alone on a spoon.Eat and enjoy!",5,"Best Peanut Butter on the Planet",1118880000,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","I was expecting something that tasted more like Laura Scudders. I did not at all like the addition of sugar and oil to this product.",1,"Yuck",1375833600,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","LOVE THIS PB!! It is very good, better than I thought it would be. It has a little bit of sweetness, but not too much. Very satisfied.",5,"LOVE!",1360972800,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","The title of this review says it all. There is something seriously amiss with the thinking apparatus of anyone who will spend 23$ for one jar of peanut butter.No?",1,"23$ for one jar of peanut butter?",1377993600,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","It tastes like sunflower seed oil. YUK! I've tried maaaaaany peanut butters and this one by far is the worst out of the organic kind",2,"Where's the Peanuts in this?",1369872000,"2014-08-19"
"B0000CEQD5","NATURAL, LOVE THE NON-SUGARY UNPROCESSED TASTE THAT THE OTHER PEANUT BUTTERS DON'T HAVE. CAN SPOON OFF SOME OF THE OIL AND DISCARD WITHOUT LOSING TOO MUCHY CREAMY TEXTURE,TOO, WHEN 1ST OPENED!",5,"Absolute Best",1148342400,"2014-08-19"

"B00028PVHW","My wife has been using this for years...  good alternative to 'regular' sodium salt. Because the review wasn't long enough to submit, I'll say it again, good alternative to 'regular' sodium salt.",4,"Good stuff.",1369094400,"2010-03-25"

"B00028PVHW","Crazy as it may seem, I was so excited to see this vege salt available! I used to get it ages ago & was surprised to not see it in stores near me. Vege-Sal does not have actual salt, but vegetables as ground seasoning, so this is great to reduce salt intake & have flavor at the same time! It is awesome on popcorn!",5,"Love the Vege- Sal",1367452800,"2010-03-25"
"B00028PVHW","I have this on eggs every morning.  Try taking a whole chicken and preparing it, then drying it with paper towels and then rubbing it inside and out with Vege-Sal.  Even under the breast skin.  Let it sit for 24 hours then olive oil lightly and roast at 170 breasts down until the internal hits 170.",5,"Great Product!",1390176000,"2010-03-25"

"B00028PVHW","I am an avid cook, spent 30 years in the hotel business and ran my own bed and breakfast where I cooked for all of the weddings and events.  Although not salt free, I use it in place of salt for many dishes, especially poultry, beef and pork.  It is wonderful on fresh Tomatoes.  Not sure what I would do without it in the kitchen.  Could not recommend it more highly.I first learned about Vege-Sal while living on a wonderful vegetarian commune in the early 70's.  It has been around a long time.",5,"I Absolutely Love It!",1400198400,"2010-03-25"

"B00028PVHW","I've been using this product for decades, and it is my all time favorite seasoning. I especially love it on eggs, cottage cheese, and avocados; but I use it in/on everything that I would use salt in/on. It allows you to use less salt and still get a great flavor. I also prefer it over other spike seasonings due to it's fine grind - a little goes a long way and it isn't crunchy.

Yes, I still use Kosher salt on/off, but Vege Sal is the ""cat's meow"" when it comes to a sprinkle on eggs, vegetables, and all kinds of potatoes.......  You don't get that ""after"" taste like you do from regular salt = ""I'm thirsty""..  It's a very quiet seasoning with loads of flavor.  Enjoy",5,"Happy Again",1374364800,"2010-03-25"
"B00028PVHW","This has salt in it, which is the only drawback, and probably why it makes food taste so good!  My husband has discovered it and uses it pretty liberally in his cooking, but it makes everything taste delicious.  I believe it is lower in salt than most products, other than the ones that have no salt at all.  It also contains a variety of vegetable flavorings and spices. I bought it the first time in a local store, but cannot find it now, so have ordered it on Amazon this time.  It is a good all round flavoring and I would recommend it to anyone who cooks or eats.",5,"Good stuff",1363737600,"2010-03-25"

It's fabulous on a whole chicken, simply rinse, pat dry and rub with VS all over, inside, under the breast skin, etc.  Plastic sack and seal and leave in the refrigerator for a couple of days.  Remove, lightly olive or canola oil and roast breast side down for 75 minutes, then flip 180 and continue to roast for 15 minutes.  It's the veritable essence of comfort food.

"B00028QD2Y","As more and more stores get conglomerated, and product choices diminish, it is great to be able to reach out to Amazon and grab a long-time favorite. We have used for years as an alternative to table salt. Not a salt substitute, not fake or phony, yet better if you do not want too much salt in your diet. By adding great vegetable taste through natural foods, it lowers the amount of salt that a normal dose would deliver. I have recently seen scientific results showing that salt phobia is non-sense, not a health risk at all.

I did not need to take all the time it took me to learn that the name has changed. I might just look for a more stabily named product.

Don't you know a good thing when you already have it?????????????  Change the explanation not the name of what it does, a salt substitute!!! If you are chasing another market, create a new product with a similar name  to fit the market and use that until it is comforable to combine the two products into one ""named"" product.

A mixture of vinegar, spices (garic chief among them), onion and citrus juices (lime, bitter orange), Mojo Criollo will impart a full, tangy flavor to whatever meat or poultry you're cooking, as well as add to it's overall juicyness. Wonderful for grilling (grilled some chicken breasts marinated in it earlier tonight), and a vital addition to black beans if you want to prepare them in the traditional Cuban manner (my mother, a native of Jovellanos, Matanzas in Cuba swears by it...and I'll swear by her black beans).",5,"Great marinade for grilling, and a whole lot more...",1122508800,"2015-02-13"

It's not oily, but gloriously light and has an intense aroma as soon as you open it. Smells of cumin, citrus, garlic and all things heavenly play together when you use it on beef or chicken. I've yet to try it on pork, but I can only imagine it'd be great as well. When baking chicken, I marinate the breasts in this at least 30 minutes prior to throwing them in the oven with a little of the residual juice from the marinade sitting in the bottom of a baking dish.

There are a bunch of recipes for it on the web and many of them call for one or two packets of this stuff and I have to say, it perks up that soup and pretty much any Latin dish in a noticeable way.  If you like Mexican food, Tex-Mex, Cuban or any of the whole Latin American flavor genre, this is something to have in your cooking arsenal.  Good stuff.

NOTHING, but makes all the difference in taste).  and if you think you are depending on 5 grams of protein from your bar, it's like a couple percentage points of your daily intake- a cup of milk has twice that, or a tblspn of protein powder- it's NOTHING, yet enough to ruin the flavor and consistency of what could have been a great tasting bar).I agree that these bars, along with their peanut and chocolate protein, are among Kashi's best stuff (as opposed to for instance the caramel, which DEFINES dry, and their oatmeal rasin, which has more calories than a CANDY BAR), and if you are using these as some say as a ""meal replacement"" lol then I guess every gram of protein counts for you, but I still cannot recommend these considering there is such a better tasting alternative at less than half the price (Nature's Valley Fruit&Nut; TrMx are also all natural btw).I mean seriously, how are people recommending these bars if they are having to SPRINKLE SWEETNER on them lol, and admit they are dry as well.",2,"ok taste but DRY:  there is a BETTER, CHEAPER alternative",1150588800,"2009-02-02"

"B0007LXU0E","i see amazon jumbled all the reviews up for the different kashi bars.  So when i tried to review the peanut peanut butter flavor it wouldn't let me, it told me i already reviewed them.  I knew i hadn't so i did some investigating & to my horror i discovered a 5 star review with my name on it raving about how good they are! but that review was intended for & posted under another flavor bar! (I posted it a while ago for the cherry dark chocolate trail mix bars, which are really good. Also the chocolate peanut protein ones are good too)  All i can say is ""ACK!!!!!!""  I hate that it looks like i am reccommending these nasty peanut butter ones because i am NOT. i hate them. the box i received sucked.  I've never eaten something with so much peanut in it that had so little flavor.  It's like they used a magic machine to suck the flavor out of the peanuts.  I did eat half the box over the course of a few weeks, thinking that maybe they would grow on me.  But after just finishing another one i think i can say with certainty that the only thing growing is a cavity on my back molar.  (they are not tasty but they certainly are chewy.)  In my opinion they are not worth rotting your teeth out of your head for. and what a complete waste of calories too! I feel like i should go jogging again today. Anyway,  i would have MUCH rather eaten those yummy pumpkin spice flax bars, which are a crucnhy variety & my favorite flavor.

"B0007LXU0Y","after tasting it, but looking at the ingredient list, there is almond flour in it and I am allergic...Can't Kashi make a peanut granola bar w/o other nuts in them?",1,"I wish I could review this",1335398400,"2009-02-02"
"B0007LXU0Y","The first thing that drew me to these was the terrific combination of dark chocolate, a coffee element, and almonds. I realize that not all tastes and/or ingredients one might like independently would necessarily taste great together, but I knew that the combination of these 3 ingredients could 'make magic happen'. :)An ingredient profile is a great start, and includes the fact that for this product, the '3 stars of our show' :) were not accompanied by crap (which is very important to me, especially given 'how' I intended to use this product), but the nutrition profile would 'make or break' whether, and if so how much, I might end up eating these granola bars.The most surprising things (and positively so) about this product's nutrition profile, in my opinion, are as follows --* Each bar is only 130 calories (and while that might be 'too' low for anyone intending to use this product as a meal replacement, one could eat two of them and still be below what so many other snack bars and 'healthy snacks' come in at, calorie-wise) (besides, one can always eat more of something that is low in calories, versus more readily 'cutting back' on something that is high in calories [and especially if the higher calorie item does not involve much volume, or an otherwise satisfyingly 'full' feeling after eating a 'cut back' version of such]).* Calories are one thing, but it's the breakdown of what those calories are comprised of, that makes 'the' difference, for me -- and each of these granola bars has 6g of protein, 4g of fiber (3g of which are insoluble), 1.5g of monounsaturated fat, only 0.5g of saturated fat, only 90mg of sodium, and what positively stunned me was that each bar has only 6g of sugar -- THAT is remarkable, and is of benefit not only in and of itself, but is so important to those who must pay special attention to their blood sugar, including those who contend with insulin resistance.Ingredients and nutrition are important, but taste ends up being a kind of 'trump card' -- and, thankfully, these taste good!They have a texture that is kind of 'in between' that of a thicker-textured 'rice cake' (sort of), and a rice krispie treat (albeit with noticeably less of the 'tack-like' aspect found with [marshmallow 'glue' -rendered] rice krispie treats).These granola bars don't 'feel' 'heavy' in the stomach (and yet can satisfy hunger) -- and what this 'lighter in the stomach' aspect allows for, importantly, for my needs, is that these are one of the only 'foods' that I can eat during a workout (sometimes, if I haven't eaten enough before a workout, or otherwise 'push' past what I'd originally intended, activity-wise, and find that I need a few more calories, these fit the bill [and sometimes it's just a bite or two, taken while mid-workout, but given the nutrient profile, it makes a difference (and keeps me from getting lightheaded, or otherwise not having enough energy to engage in physical activity)]).This product has now replaced what previously used to be the only granola bar I would eat (Nature Valley Oats 'n Honey Granola Bars). Additionally, a 'bonus', when compared to the Nature Valley granola bars, is that these Kashi bars don't 'crumble' -- not only when eating them, but also with respect to their 'survivability' when in a purse or gym bag -- the Kashi bars stay intact (whereas the Nature Valley granola bars would tend to get broken, and/or crumble [and could make for an annoying mess]).I now keep a few of these with me practically at all times, and eat them while 'on the go', when running errands, or when running late and needing something to 'bridge the gap' until my next meal.All in all, I am so glad that the folks at Kashi came out with this product.",5,"'Just right' in several respects, and one of the only foods I can eat during a workout",1360540800,"2009-02-02"

This is a coffee flavor granola bar !",1366761600,"2009-02-02"
"B0007LXU0Y","There is always a feeling of anxiety as I enter the granola bar aisle at the grocery store. Will the Kashi Dark Mocha Almond granola bars be sold out? Will my morning commutes be granola free? Is this just the beginning of my First World problems?First of all, these are delicious. Other ""health food"" granola options taste like cardboard or are too dry/hard to eat. On the flip side, other cloyingly sweet kids granola bars are just as unhealthy as a candy bar. The Kashi Dark Mocha Almond strike the perfect balance between the two. They are substantial enough as a breakfast, without resorting to empty calories.The best thing about this: it's a 6-pack of 6 bars each! Plus, they keep long enough so the 36 bars don't go to waste. With Amazon shipping (and a Prime account), I have these within two days to satisfy the craving. Plus, even when every other granola bar is in stock, the packages of Kashi Dark Mocha Almond are always sold out at the store -- Amazon saves the day again.Pros:-Scrumtrulescent-Filling-Healthy dose of complex fiber without excessive sugars-36-pack!!Cons:-I feel shameful if I eat three per day-They're too easy, other breakfast foods are neglected-The chocolate chips are tenuous -- Don't sit on a dropped chip for a 30 minute car ride",5,"Scrumtrulescent",1350604800,"2009-02-02"
"B0007LXU0Y","These are tasty Bars but small leaving you wanting more. I like Kashi, but the desire for profit as rendered them just too expensive.",3,"Just what they say.",1381795200,"2009-02-02"
"B0007LXU0Y","I was looking for an easy snack to take with me on vacation to have while I was out and about all day.  I stumbled upon these at Wal-Mart and was attracted to 1) The nutritonal content [reasonable calories, good amount of fiber and enough protein to tide me over] and 2) The word ""mocha"" in the name, as I love all things coffee.These were inexpensive, DELICIOUS, and not too sweet - which is important for me because if something is really sweet (like most granola bars are), I lose control and end up eating two or three at a time, like I would with a cookie or any other sweet treat.  But these are perfect - just enough sweetness to ""hit the spot"" without triggering a sugar craving.  I guess if you are used the typical sugary granola bars [Nature Valley, Quaker Oats and chocolate], these might not be indulgent enough for you.  But again, I like that these are not crazy-sweet.The mocha is more like a hint of coffee flavor - just enough to enhance the taste of the chocolate chips and almonds.  So if you're not a big coffee person, there's a good chance you'd still like these bars. And if you *are* a coffee person, you'll certainly enjoy these. They have a sprinkle of chocolate chips on top, and whole, yummy almonds throughout.  I bet they would be mighty good broken up into pieces and put on top of some greek yogurt, along with sliced strawberries.  What a breakfast that would make!These are definitely a winner, and I plan on buying them again and again.  Highly recommended!",5,"Delicious perfection!",1349222400,"2009-02-02"

"B0007LXU0Y","These things are terrible.  They have a beautiful picture on the box, but the bars themselves are awful.  After the first few chews there is almost no flavor and it tastes like you are eating raw meal like oatmeal.  Nutrigrain bars blow these away at a much better price.  When I complained to the company, they would only replace one of the three boxes that I purchased to try (all had taste or lack of reasonable filling issues).  I nor my family will be buying another Kashi product as a result, i.e., poor products + unethical business = Kashi.",1,"Worst Ever",1362096000,"2009-02-02"
"B0007LXU0Y","A nutritionist recommended Kashi products to me. If you're hankering for a Snicker candy bar, these might not satisfy you. However, if you want a crunchy, nutty, dark chocolate treat that makes you feel good after eating, you may want to try these.  They are low in sugar--only 6 gms--about the same as in a cup of Cheerios or Total.  The nutritionist said to think of sugar as poison--your body wants to eliminate sugar before fat, so stay low in sugar. I keep one of these bars in my purse when I'm out doing errands in case I get hungry.  I love the dark chocolate chips and nutty crunch. One bar at 130 calories is quite satisfying and is a great go-to treat when you want a little sweetness in your day.One bar is only 3 points on Weight Watcher's point system. I took a box to my Weight Watcher's meeting to recommend them for a healthy snack.  I've lost 30 pounds and reversed diabetes in the past 2 years eating healthy foods: low-sugar, low-fat natural vegetable/fruits/protein/dairy diet with little to no artificially flavored and processed foods.  These bars are my treat when I'm desiring a little fun without the guilt. I haven't found a chocolate dessert treat that's lower in calories/sugar and healthier.

I have a picky 8 yr old and he wanted to take to school for snack time. My 2 r old and 11 month old twins shared a bar and loved it. The mocha taste is very dominant, but it is a great combination with the chocolate and almonds. If you don't know what mocha taste like, it is a coffee taste.which is great because I'm trying to limit my coffee intake and this does the ticket to ween me off.",5,"Yum!",1368144000,"2009-02-02"

"B0007LXU0Y","It tastes like cardboard with a subtle flavoring of mocha.  The granola bar is so dry and tasteless, I have to drink something with it in order to even swallow.  I love most Kashi products, but this one fails imho.",1,"Yuck",1322697600,"2009-02-02"
"B0007LXU0Y","I'm not really a coffee fan, but something about this bar appealed to me.  Maybe it was the picture on the front of the box, with the bar showing lots of chocolate and almonds and the little circle saying No High Fructose corn syrup.  Whatever it was, it worked, I bought a box.And the taste wasn't too bad.  Even for not being a coffee fan I thought that this bar had a good mix of flavors.  You could definitely taste the chocolate and the coffee flavor was tolerable.  I don't drink regular mochas so I can't compare the taste there, but it seems reasonable to me to think it would be similar.  The almonds, even though I could see them in the bar didn't have much of a taste though.  I think they were a bit over-powered by everything else.  And the oats were just texture and filler rather than being a large part of the taste.  They are chewy bars, like the box advertises, but not so chewy that it is hard to get through them.  I'd say they are on par with regular granola bars and the texture that is portable yet easy to get through.Kashi has pretty decent ingredients.  This of course has their blend of different grains, almonds, corn flour, honey and some other things.  They used the honey and brown rice syrup as a sweetener with the chocolate, and there is some coffee extract included for that mocha flavor.  Altogether it makes a bar around 130 calories, which really isn't that bad compared to a lot of granola bars out there.  Protein is 6 grams and the fat content is 3.5 grams.  There aren't many vitamins to speak of, but it does have fiber and a little bit of iron.  Sugars weighed in at 6 grams, which also isn't too bad compared to a lot of other bars.It did its job and filled me up for breakfast for a few hours.  I'd have to say that after experiencing the whole box, I do want lunch a little earlier, but not much.  Perhaps pairing it with a piece of fruit would make a more filling breakfast, but as a snack this could stand just fine on its own.  I'll probably keep trying out the different flavors of these bars, and will eventually come back to this one.Review by M. Reynard 2012",4,"Kashi Dark Mocha Almond",1356480000,"2009-02-02"

"B0007LXU0Y","I had RNY gastric bypass 08/2010.  Once I passed the 6-month milestone, I was able to gradually add back in foods like granola and items with 6g of sugar or less.  I was over the moon happy to have found Kashi.  This is a great flavor, but I also love Trail Mix, Peanut Peanut Butter, and Honey Almond Flax - these 3 are sold in a variety pack together.  The protein content is great, ranging from 5 to 7 grams of protein per bar, with low sugar, and very healthy ingredients.  These bars are a staple on my grocery list.  Very WLS friendly for the Bariatric lifestyle.  I mean, an egg has 7g of protein, this is an amazing product.

They do not seem to disclose all ingredients and after further research, apparently Kashi is owned by Kellogg and donated some $790,700 dollars to defeat prop 37, GM labelling in CA.

Kashi's ""Seven Whole Grains"" which include ""hard red wheat""--not gluten free, sorry!) add 4 grams of fiber and a satisfying chewy crunchiness. This particular flavor is hard to find. Often I am greeted by empty shelves, so I am glad that I could find them here and set up a regular shipment! And by the way, these were part of my recent 28 pound weight loss.

They are people who don't READ the box and expect it to be packed with flavor and sweetness like other cakey breakfast bars.I get this along with their Mocha flavor, and yes, that has some great flavor, and this is more toned down. The honey is not strong and most likely is there more to bring out the other flavors of the almond and other bits. This is the perfect little bar for just a little something between meals and goes well with a nice cup of tea or coffee.

"B0007LXU0Y","I'm not a picky eater, and I like most of the products that Kashi makes.  Most of it's fairly healthy for what it is, but often you have to sacrifice a bit of good taste in the process.  It's often a fair trade, although I've found that a few of their products just aren't worth the sacrifice.  The ""Mocha Almond"" granola bars are barely passable, but these ""Peanut Peanut Butter"" (sic) ones are terrible!  They have very little flavor and I definitely don't taste much in the way of peanuts OR peanut butter.  Usually I'll finish a box of something just so I don't feel like I've wasted my money, but I'm giving these away ASAP.One star for the (lack of) flavor and a bonus point for the good nutrition...but I definitely won't be buying these again!",2,"Bland, bland, bland",1379462400,"2009-02-02"

Neither a treat nor a treatment, Kashi Granola bars are light and just right--a way to get started without either residual guilt over a 7 A.M. candy bar or aversion to grandma's recommended fiber remedy. One warning: they go down easy, so don't take more than a single one with you in the car (or you could wind up scarfing down all six bars between traffic lights). Also, Amazon ships these three-buck packages in a generous-sized box, which may strike some consumers as ecologically irresponsible (wish I'd saved these boxes for a recent move of my mother-in-law.

They have a lovely chewy texture with plenty of huge chunks of almond for added crunch. These are GOOD! I would love to buy them in bulk and have them shipped automatically, but I wouldn't pay more than the three dollars or so a box (of six) that Wal Mart or Target charges.

Being a huge fan of both dark chocolate and coffee, this natural bar from Kashi is a great snack at any time of the day. Quality ingredients and a reasonable price is great for what you get out of these bars. The chewy texture is great when you bite into an occasional almond and there isnt too much dark chocolate bits, but just enough to go well with the mocha flavor. I usually eat one with my coffee in the morning while at the office when I am short on time or in the evening when I dont want a big meal, but want something reasonably healthy. The bars are great when short on time and need a quick pick me up. I use them with some juice in the morning when just waking and going for a spin class. Easy on the stomach at least for me.

I do not prefer overly sweet products, but these truly don't have any sweetness - or saltiness, or flavor at all, except maybe the chalky cardboard flavor. The bars are truly unremarkable except in the wonderment that others have ranked them with extra stars.

"B0007LXU0Y","My sister and I are on the Flat Belly Diet from Prevention magazine. The Flat Belly Diet is loosely based upon The Mediteranean (SP) Diet.With that diet I have lost 11.25 pounds and these TLC bars have helped. With the Flat Belly Diet and the Mediteranean Diet you eat a MUFA (mono unsaturated fatty acid. MUFAs are calorie dense. One ounce of salted nuts, or 1/2 avocado have a MUFA, and have about 1/2 of the calories you can have at a meal. Dark chocolate has MUFA too. But Ghiradelli is about the only source for 60% cacao, but there is something in Ghiradeli chocolates that upsets my stomach.These TLC bars have dark chocolate which gives you a MUFA. the fruits and grains fills you up too. Best of all one Of these bars only has 130 calories, and it is much easier to fit in my diet than many of the other MUFA containing foods.If you are looking for a diet; I can Highly recommend either the Flat Belly Diet, or the Mediteranean diet. They are the easiest diets I have ever been on, and best of all the diets are virtually pain free.I am sure you have seen the infomercials that say ""eat all of you favorite foods""With this flat belly diet; I really do eat all of my favorite foods. I still have potato chips, ice cream, CocaCola, lasagna, etc within reason, and as long as I eat a food containing a MUFA, and keep my caloric intake down to 1600 calories a day I lose weight. This crazy sounding diet works because of the MUFA. MUFAs provide your body with healthy fats, and these healthy fats keeps you satisfied between meals.I paid $2.99 for a kindle version of the Flat Belly Pocket Guide. I have shed 11.25 pounds and feel much better.",5,"I LOVE these bars.",1331596800,"2009-02-02"

I carry around one of the fruit loops packages in my backpack, just as a great snack.I do want to warn though, that Amazon shipped them to me in a single box and about 20 of the containers arrived opened inside the box because the outer box was a little damaged, but being the great company they are, Amazon promptly shipped another box ""free of charge"" and allowed me to keep the ones from the original shipment that made it here okay.

"B000CSCP1C","I buy all my cereal from Amazon. I am usually very pleased with products received from Amazon. This box of cereal bowls contained several bowls that were open! All of the varieties I tried were stale and didn't taste right; and the Raisin Bran actually seemed rotten. The first thing I did after encountering these problems was to check for an expiration or use by date. There was no indication on any of the packaging ANYWHERE as to when these bowls of cereal would no longer be appropriate for human consumption. By comparison, the General Mills cereals I've purchased from Amazon have expiration dates on each and every individual bowl (usually printed on the bottom). Kellogg's makes great cereals - I have no problem with Kellogg's - I think I got a bad box that had been stored away in the back of some warehouse somewhere that should have been discarded because it was way past its shelf-life. Amazon, of course, refunded my money. But, just beware that it could happen to you and if it does be sure to get Amazon to refund your money. Amazon's warehouses need to be more vigilant. We can't just complain on here and hope the warehouses change their practices - we need to make our money talk to Amazon so they will get warehouse management/personnel to comply with Amazon standards and federal consumer laws.",1,"All stale; some opened; none w/ Exp.

In fact, we say... &#34;Wanna have bacon, eggs and Pamela's?&#34;  We don't even say pancakes any more.... the reason it's so good is the almond flour. It's designed for gluten free people, but anyone who has it a few times... especially with buttermilk instead of water... will not want any other pancake mix. It's sooooooo good! I think we'll have some in the morning. How about you? Pamela's anyone? Yes. That's my recommendation. Bon Appetit!",5,"No one makes a pancake mix like Pamela's",1402876800,"2013-01-19"

My husbands Mom also has celiac's disease and agree's this is a great product, she came to visit for Christmas and we made pancakes out of it while she was here and she went home and bought some right away.

"B000DZDJ0K","I purchased the Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix primarily for pancakes. I am not allergic to wheat (someone I know is) nor am I on a gluten free diet, but I wanted to try this baking mix out and give some to my friend. The box of six packages was a good deal because of the bulk discount and it allowed for me to give some away as gifts, as well do some of my own baking.I'd definitely buy this product again and I would try other Pamela's Products. I also recommend it to anyone with wheat/gluten free diet needs who is looking for something that tastes good with a pleasant texture as well.The pancakes were amazing! The resulting texture and flavor is by far better than most other pancake mixes I have tried...in fact, I think this may be my all-time favorite pancake mix and I usually eat pancakes with wheat flour in them.Aside from pancakes, I baked blueberry muffins with this mix. They turned out fantastic! If I remember right, I used real butter and whole milk when baking with this mix though Pamela offers low-fat variations on the package. The directions and recipe variations on the packaging are very helpful.I really enjoy the texture with the almond meal and blend of different flours. The pancakes are not too heavy or grainy--which you might expect from a wheat free baking product containing something like almond meal--but they do have a texture that differs from a pure wheat flour pancake. The texture was perhaps even more ideal for muffins. Yummy!",5,"Yummy Pancakes and Muffins!",1331337600,"2013-01-19"

"B000DZDJ0K","Greetings,As I get older, I'm finding that certain types of foods no longer work well for me.  So far, I can't eat chocolate that's less than about 60% cocoa.  Milk chocolate is out, completely.  Same for peanuts.  Lately, I've been trying to cut way back on wheat gluten, as that is causing problems, too.  If I eat too many products that contain wheat gluten, I get a stuffy nose, and also can develop some skin eczema.  After trying quite a few gluten-free products, we were very happy to find Pamela's Products Ultimate Baking & Pancake Mix!!  This stuff is simply fantastic!  I have been making waffles with it, often, and they turn out fluffy, tasty, and very enjoyable!  The great part is I can now eat four waffles, and do NOT get a stuffy nose at all!!  YIPPEE!!!  They taste wonderfully delicious, too, and if I want to make several batches, they also freeze well.  I would recommend reheating them in the oven, rather than the microwave, however, as they have a better consistency that way.  I cannot recommend Pamela's mix more strongly, and am very happy to have found this outstanding company!  Now, we're trying other products from Pamela's, and hope they will turn out to be just as great as this wonderful mix we now use.  Pamela's has made two more life-long customers out of my wife and I, and we wish them a very long and successful business, so we can keep buying this great mix from them!  If you are having gluten problems, I whole-heartedly recommend that you give this sumptuous mix a try.  I'm sure you will not be disappointed!

"B000DZDJ0K","Pancakes are good and do not taste like they are missing the glu. I made some drop biscuits using this mix and they were better than bisquick. However, I figured that each biscuit is at least 200 calories and over 7 grams of fat per biscuit. Aaah, now I know why I wanted to eat so many of them. My doctor says to try gluten free, as I have had an unexplained leg rash for many years now. My gluten test was negative, but I was told, that I could still be gluten sensitive. So, I am trying to cut it from my diet. Problem is, I also need to cut calories. I can't see eating Pamelas products regularly... As I will likely balloon even larger than I am now. But, when I must have bread or baked goods or go insane, these products fit the bill. The drop biscuits were extremely good. I think I will make them for the holidays...just make them smaller, and maybe add some cheese and spices to replicate Those Red Lobster biscuits that I love. The recipe for Pamelas diner drop biscuits are on the web. I used butter instead of shortening, and cut the butter into the dry mix before adding cottage cheese and milk. I used too much cottage cheese...and I thought the mistake tasted great. I saved the leftovers, reheated in oven...they got really crunchy on outside and browner than before... Tasted even better the second baking. Be careful, you will want to eat them all in one sitting....",4,"Great tasting... But beware of calories and fat",1291852800,"2013-01-19"

"B000DZDJ0K","This is by far my family's fave pancake mix. Before several of us had to go GF, I used to make pancakes from scratch. I have tried to make them from scratch since going GF, and this mix is way better than the results I got making them myself. Even my non-GF family members love them.One note: it is really easy to mis-measure the mix, in my experience. I kind of pack it into the measuring cup (make sure you use a dry measure). The thicker the batter, the higher the cakes rise, and we like them fluffy. If the batter is too thin, they will not rise much. It is just personal preference, but can be adjusted to your liking by adding or reducing mix.I like to make huge batches of these, cool them on a rack, and freeze them. They can be microwaved or heated in a toaster easily- just the thing for a quick breakfast on a school day, when frozen waffles and pancakes aren't an option.

However, I never would have considered substituting anything for my Bisquick pancakes.  But I figured when the new nanny brought over a tiny box of gluten free Bisquick that she paid $4.59 for, there had to be something better.

It's absolutely superb -- and I'm pretty snippety about my pancakes.  This mix makes pancakes that are rather less sweet, but much more flavorful.  Only problem: whereas I used to have pancakes perhaps twice a month with breakfast, I now have them twice a week.

Give it a try.  I paid $6.89 for just one at the local health food store. This is a much better deal!I wanted to add that I posted this description under Pamela's Pancake mix. I have also used the Chocolate cake mix and the bread mix. Since this is posted under all 3 for some reason I will comment on those too. The Bread mix is very good. It does take a little tweaking, maybe it's my bread machine. It is very good, everyone in the family likes it. We have made pizza crust out of it for my little girl and she loves it. We have made the cookies from the pancake mix and she loves them, we add cinnamon and sugar to them before baking. The Chocolate Cake mix is very good, it is more of a dark chocolate than a milk chocolate. We make cupcakes out of them and freeze them. Nice and fluffy. She loves them too. All in all I would say that if you can't have wheat, Pamela's products are the best choice for flavor and texture. Don't buy that already made bread.

Using this recipe, I have served these pancakes to Sunday school kids (dozens of them, ages 9 - 14), countless sleepovers and repeatedly to a non-gluten free brother and sister.

"B000DZDJ0K","My new perfect-world 'wish list item' is a 'collection' that has one of each of the bag-style mixes that Pamela makes. I mean geez buying a whole collection of any given thing just to try it out is pretty expensive! But this bake mix rocks.I didn't use to think I had any dietary issues. When I was 35 I suddenly developed 'severe asthma' but had never had it before. But when I accidentally dropped gluten from my diet (eating mostly meats/eggs/veggies for 3 weeks) I discovered that my ""severe asthma,"" and a decent chunk of my allergies, acne, acid reflux, brain fog, etc. were apparently due to gluten. Ironically grain-based foods have been the primary foods my entire life, sigh.Giving up everything remotely bread-like really sucked. I did it for the sake of keeping my sugar intake low (carbs are either fiber or sugar--so a bagel tends to have more sugar to the body than a candy bar) but once in awhile I would just leap off the wagon and eat something baked. The problem was, it wasn't just that I'd be increasing my sugar/carb intake, which I can live with now and then, but I'd be getting gluten too, and would discover by nightfall when it became inconvenient to breathe that my 'severe asthma' was back. (Why more people with asthmatic kids don't at least *try* serious food eliminations is beyond me...) My boyfriend's docs after much testing tried to diagnose him with Crohns and IBS, insisting he is not celiac [like his sister] and should just keep eating those healthy (...) whole grains. But it turns out when he avoids gluten for awhile, he isn't sick and in pain, he's just fine, as an amazing coincidence. So in the process of experimenting, we've discovered Pamela's brand. It is a dream come true.Pancakes. Waffles. Cookies. Cakes. Breaded fried chicken. We don't use it very often (as we're mostly lowcarb) but when we do, my 13 year old gives it two thumbs up... There is nothing we've tried to make with this, pretty much using it like flour for the most part, that has not come out good. I am hugely grateful for Pamela's brand making gluten-free eating just as tasty as mainstream food. Since I unfortunately am only 'inconvenienced' by gluten (as opposed to genuine *pain*) I'm the type that would occasionally eat it anyway just because I so missed a lifetime food that was based on grains. Thanks to Pamela's, now I can have those foods once in awhile without damaging my body in the process. Yay!

Believe it or not, I make the coookies 2-3 times a week...it is such an easy recipe and takes no time at all to mix up. The other night , I did not have time to bake them so I just put the batter in the fridge. The next day, just used a small icecream scooper to form small balls and put them on the sheet. I usually spray the small scooper with PAM and scoop up the dough and the balls will pop right out...have uniform size cookies!

"B000DZDJ0K","My husband and I just recently went gluten free. I had just mastered HOME MADE WHOLE WHEAT BREAD BY HAND!!!! (I know, total bummer). After much searching for some sort of substitute (we tried a lot of gritty, nasty, no good stuff King Arthur GF flour comes to mind) we found this. It makes DELICIOUS waffles (we haven't done pancakes and honestly we love waffles so much we might not). We've made drop biscuits (recipe is on the back of the BIG bag) and they were LIKE NORMAL BISCUITS!!! We have made cookies with this product that were almost just as good (I am picky with my cookies). We made banana bread that wasn't bad (I suggest adding chocolate chips to any banana bread recipe).THIS is the GF flour we use. OH we fried chicken in this too (I do 1 cup Pamela's, 1/2 c of Parmesan cheese, 1 packet of Spaghetti sauce mix the stuff you make at home that you add to tomato paste, etc.and 1-2 tsp of Garlic salt.

"B000DZDJ0K","Cooking and baking gluten-free is quite an adventure&#8230; When I first started working with gluten-free cooking (over a decade ago) the products available in mainstream stores were scarce, and it was painfully brought home to me how important it is to read labels carefully. In the end, I mixed my own flours and painfully, through trial and error, learned how to make edible, delicious gluten-free baked goods.I discovered Pamela&#8217;s products a few years ago. I read the label carefully and found myself thinking, &#8220;These are the same things I use!&#8221;  So, I tried the pancake and baking mix. Wonderful pancakes and waffles. Yummy cookies&#8230;. Awesome applesauce cake&#8230; Moist, light crumb, no grainy texture, no awful aftertaste.I went from buying all of the flours I needed separately-- having to buy too much-- Oh, my! No mixing all those ingredients and filling my freezer with all the excess&#8230;Please be sure to check labels. Some people with nut and/or dairy allergies cannot use this product. It contains almond meal and buttermilk solids. Thankfully, that is not an issue with us.This is a wonderful product. I am grateful for it every day. I also use Pamela's Products Amazing Wheat Free & Gluten-free Bread Mix, and Pamela&#8217;s gluten free cornbread mix. Both are delicious and wonderful products.

I was able to slice up the bread and put it in the freezer to preserve it for when it is needed.We recommend Pamela's Products to everyone whether they are gluten free or not. I have been gluten free for over 4 years. I could never make a great and tasty bread until now. This bread is soft and easy to slice. The best part is not having to toast it to taste better. I love having sandwiches so this was also the best part of this Christmas gift.A special thank you for Pamela's Products....

It doesn't have a gritty texture like alot of the other GF mixes out there, and makes the most wonderful muffins, pancakes and crepes. I'm eating a delicious blueberry muffin as I type and order my case! I paid $5.69 for one bag of the mix when I purchased from the store, but Amazon has it here at $4.00 a bag when you buy the case. A great savings and I know I'll go through the case quickly!I'm trying the chocolate cookie recipe on the bag next and as any GF eating person knows, it's difficult to find a good GF chocolate chip cookie!

"B000DZDJ0K","Dont we just love this gluten free pancake mix; we tired it first by buying a single packet from the store and tried this with a couple of other brands found in WHoleFoods.  Hands down this flour mix was by far the best and why we loved it:- the mixture forms beautifully on the griddle [good circular shape]- not runny consistency even when you follow the instructions- had a nice buttery  taste (no butter added)- we added a 1.5 tablespoon of flax mix with the 1 cup of flour and that only further enhanced the flavor and goodness- cooked evenly and was easy to flip to cook other sidethese may seems like obvious points, but some other larger GF brand really didnt meet the standard.  Actually this tsate a whole heap better than using either plain white or whole wheat flour.  I would recommend this brand for GF or non-GF.

I recently discovered that I'm sensitive to wheat/gluten and was worried about being able to enjoy things like my Saturday morning pancake breakfasts. I tried Pamela's pancake and baking mix and I honestly like these pancakes better than any of the regular mixes I've used in the past. They were so good I found I was using a lot less syrup which is another plus.I went to the website and they demonstrated making 1 minute microwaved bread with this mix. I'd tried some commercial gluten free bread and couldn't choke it down (although I did find a brand today that I like). So I tried the microwaved bread. It reminds me in consistency of sourdough bread. Taste was ok - I'm not much on the taste of white bread to begin with so others might not agree with me. But definitely toast it before you eat it. I tried it untoasted and it was pretty bland (like most white bread), but I did enjoy it after I toasted it.

"B000DZDJ0K","I purchased this based on reviews here on Amazon. Big Mistake!!! As soon as I received my shipment I went online to the Pamela's Products website and printed out recipes. So far I have tried 3 recipes and none of them have turned out even close to what they were supposed to be! I followed them to the letter and nada!First recipe was ""Cut Biscuits"". Turns out that their recipe for ""Drop Biscuits"" and ""Cut Biscuits"" is exactly the same and very runny. I decided to make ""Drop Biscuits"" instead because the batter was so runny and they didn't even rise. All I ended up with was some hard lumps on a cookie sheet that were dry.Next I printed the ""No Yeast By Hand Bread Loaf Recipe"". That didn't rise either and it came out the consistency of cornbread not like any kind of bread that you could actually make a grilled sandwich with or toast as the website claims.Ever the glutton for punishment, I decided to try the ""Bread Machine With Yeast Recipe"" from the website. I tried it twice on two different settings. First I tried the ""One Rise Rapid Cycle"" for gluten free bread and then I tried the ""Normal Cycle"" for white bread as the website says and they both ""fell"" (collapsed in the middle) shortly after the baking cycle started!!!I have now wasted money, eggs, olive oil, several yeast packets, time etc. and all I have to show for it is 4 1/2 bags of useless flour that isn't working with the recipes provided by the company that made it and I don't know how to use it for anything else. I had previously purchased products from ""Gluten Free Pantry"" and I never had any problems with their products.I only purchased this because of the reviews and because I could get it in bulk on Amazon for a better price. I will certainly be canceling my subscription for this product. Lesson learned, knowledge acquired...***Addendum: I decided to request a call from Amazon to let them know that the product may be defective because it was not performing correctly and to my surprise they offered me a full refund!!! I wasn't expecting that! And to think that I nearly decided to just let it go and chalk it up to experience.

"B000DZDJ0K","I really like this mix. It makes very crispy waffles and pretty good pancakes. I made waffles for my family using this mix and they loved them.However....I personally prefer a heavier/breadier pancake and waffle, like those made with Bisquick. This mix, no matter how I've varied the recipes, tends to make thin, crispy products. The waffles are very light and crispy. The pancakes are more crepe-like.And making biscuits didn't turn out too well. I had too use 1/2 the butter called for because using the full amount (as written on the Pamela's website) resulted in a buttery crumble. Using 1/2 the butter made a less buttery crumble that sort of stayed together.All that said, I do like this mix. BUT I recently found the Pamela's Scone and Biscuit mix and tried making pancakes with it using roughly the same measurements as this mix. They were fantastic! In fact, very similar to Bisquick style- thick, bready and tasty.If you like heavier pancakes and waffles, I recommend using the scone mix instead.",5,"Tasty but Biscuit and Scone Mix makes better pancakes.",1385251200,"2013-01-19"

"B000DZDJ0K","This mix is easy to prepare and makes nice, light pancakes, but I find I have to add 2 to 3 teaspoons of vanilla for flavor or else they don't taste like much. I tried using the recipe on the side of the package for chocolate chip cookies, and they were terrible - the taste and texture weren't good at all. Then I tried the waffle recipe. They were ok, but again, they didn't taste like much. And if you don't eat them all right away, they get soggy; freezing and toasting didn't help much, they just burned in the toaster. So far, the best recipe I have found for waffles/pancakes comes from the book The Best Gluten Free Family Cookbook by Donna Washburn and Heather Butt. You have to buy several flours (sorghum, almond, brown rice, and soy) and two starches to make the mix, but it's totally worth it. As for Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix, I know everyone else raves about it, and for pancakes the texture is surprisingly like regular wheat pancakes, but taste is blah and the other recipes aren't very good. I used up my case of 6, but won't be repurchasing.UPDATE**I had been unhappy with using this as a baking mix until I tried the recipe for muffins on the side of the bag. I made them exactly as directed, using honey and frozen blueberries as the fruit. They are delicious.

"B000F6SLM8","I had never heard of these, and when I came across the product listing I thought these were going to be more like ""around the house snacks"" given the description and comments.These are only really enjoyable to eat in the same way whey protein shakes or powerbars or other ""good for you"" meal replacement or snack-like food units are enjoyable:  they stop the hunger with a minimum of fuss.The balls are fairly dense.. prepare to ""gnaw"" on them.  Taking a bite is a commitment.  The texture with all the exterior seeds is coarse.  The peanut butter flavor is, well, faint.  Using the words ""great tasting"" in the marketing is stretching the truth a bit, IMHO.  (I would not buy these for taste alone.)On the plus side, they work.  I was running out of the house without having had breakfast, so I threw two balls in my pocket and ate them in the first 10 minutes of driving.  My hunger reacted the same way it would to any other 400-calorie breakfast -- it went away, and stayed away until lunch.  There was no negative aftertaste or other unpleasantness, and it made me feel like I had eaten food rather than some sort of snacky candy thing.I don't have a particular allergy related need for this product, although I like the fact that it doesn't use refined sugar.

Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second. Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others.

"B000FDCVOK","Sylvia's Restaurant in NYC is considered by many transplants to be the best place to grab real Southern-style chow in the city. I used to eat there when I lived in New York and I can tell you the meals she serves are pretty darned good. That's why I ordered this rub, mainly to use on the spare ribs and pork shoulders I smoke in my backyard.This is a very good base rub. It has more of a kick than other rubs I've tried, which I like. It isn't blazing hot or anything, but the paprika and the mustard add a nice tang. The flavor is balanced but bold. It isn't a delicately-flavored spice mix, which, again, I think of as a good thing; BBQ should provide a little kick, and this rub does. You can control that zing by 1) how much rub you use (I add a lot), 2) how long you let the meat marinate with the rub (I go overnight with it) and 3) how many additional ingredients you add to the mix (I add a few).I call this a base rub because I think adding a few things to your spice mix is a good thing. Me, I usually add to this rub some additional brown sugar and some Italian spice mix before applying to the meat. If I want something a little different, I'll add a bit of nutmeg or maybe some ground celery seed, which is something you'll find in BBQ rubs and sauces at places like Kansas City's Gates' Restaurants or the many Famous Dave's scattered throughout the Midwest. With BBQ, personalization is always a good thing. But don't feel you have to go crazy if you want to keep things simple; this rub is satisfying as is, straight out of the shaker.I bought the pack of 12 because 1) the price is excellent (most competing rubs with this kind of flavor usually sell for at least twice the price) and 2) you'll likely use up the rub more quickly than you think. For every two racks of ribs I cook, for instance, I end up using at least two-thirds of a 5.5-ounce container. Since I cook ribs and pork shoulder pretty often, I run through this stuff fairly quickly, especially during the summer.If you like to use rub on steak or chicken, you'll tear through your supply more quickly. If you don't use it as frequently as I do, you won't have much of a problem: Just store your rub someplace cool and dark and it'll keep a long time.I've used a number of store-bought rubs over the years, including those from Arthur Bryant's and the aforementioned Famous Dave's (which are also very good, by the way). I can honestly say Sylvia's is one of my favorites -- not just because of the taste, but because of the bang you get for your buck.By the way, here's a little trivia. Years ago, before I moved to NYC, I read an interview with Sylvia in Molly O'Neill's ""New York Cookbook"" where Sylvia said she doesn't smoke her pork ribs but just slow cooks them in an oven, using rub to add the BBQ-ey flavor. Not using smoke gets a lot of 'cue stalwarts riled up, but that's just the way her family had always fixed ribs and that's how she still fixes them today. And they're excellent. So if you catch grief from some food snob for cooking your ribs indoors without smoke, don't fret: Sylvia has your back.",5,"A very good rub for ribs",1225929600,"2015-01-29"

I find Amazon's prices beat the local grocery, it's always packed well, and the expiration dates are over a year away. I eat a lot of these as I tend to run Iron poor in my blood, and the doc said that oysters are probably one of the best (read most easily digestible) sources for Iron.

"B000FEDHXI","These oysters taste good, no question, but cottonseed oil is unhealthful. If you want details (you should), google on, for example, ""Dr Weil cottonseed oil"". I'll quote a tiny bit: ""[Cottonseed oil is] definitely not [OK]. [...] in my book, [...] one of the first things I ask readers to do is to go through their pantry shelves and throw out anything made with cottonseed oil. I regard it as unhealthy because it is too high in saturated fat and too low in monounsaturated fat. What's more, cottonseed oil may contain natural toxins and probably has unacceptably high levels of pesticide residues (cotton is not classified as a food crop, and farmers use many agrichemicals when growing it).""So there you have it.When buying oysters (or sardines, or tuna, or whatever) in oil, I use the following heuristic: eitherolive oil(like Crown Prince (best prices at Trader Joe's), or no oil at all (go for water, or tomato sauce, or similar). If you want oysters, go with Crown Prince oysters, which are packed in pure olive oil and can be had from Trader Joe's for two-twenty-nine a tin (I'm not affiliated with them in any way, shape, or form: this is my personal opinion based on direct experience with the product that I bought myself with me own good money).12/09/2013: TMBatKK wrote in a comment:""Cottonseed oil has polysat fat, which decreases LDL's and raises HDL's which is actually heart healthy.""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing: First, there's no such thing as ""polysat"" fat. What TMBatKK means, most likely, is polyUNsaturated fats. Some (but not all) of them are beneficial: these are the Omega-3 polyunsaturated fats, ALA. There's a negligible amount of those in cottonseed oil. There's a lot of the other kind: Omega-6 -- these are rather harmful and over-present in our diet already. Second, there's no evidence that cholesterol is the cultprit in heart disease. I don't want to get into this topic deeper, just research on your own. The theory of cholesterol being a ""bad"" substance may yet turn out to be wrong. Third, my complaints were not just about cottonseed oil's fat profile -- there's this pesky issue if cotton not being a food crop and its likely exposure to pesticides/fertilizers/etc. Please re-read Weil's statement quoted in the original part of this review.",1,"Oysters are great food, but cottonseed oil is bad for you.",1315958400,"2012-05-29"

"B000H23Z1C","With ingedients in four packets, make it hot or not as you wish. Start with the recipe on the box.

I reduced the quantity of this lean mix to 1.5 lbs from 2 lbs. I also sauteed with the meat 3/4 cup onion and 3/4 cup mixed Anaheim and Jalapeno chopped peppers.Thicken with a roux made from the included Masa flour (corn flour) or not depending on your taste. The result can be not only geat chili but also great taco filling, enchilada sauce, or nacho topping.

"B000H23Z1C","Friends, I love good food. This Chili Kit by Carroll Shelby is excellent. It creates an extremely savory basic chili that is easy to adjust to your particular taste in the areas of: spicy/hot, salt, or thickness.The flavor created by the spices in the main packet is the best attribute. Lots of deep, low, earthy tones that have excellent complexity and subtlety.Another great feature is the brilliant strategy of putting the cayenne pepper in a separate pouch. I only put in a little. My wife likes her chili slightly warm: warm enough to be interesting. So, I put about 1/8th of the cayenne pouch when I cook the chili, then I sprinkle extra on only my serving when I eat my bowl-full. I like a little more warmth to add to the complex flavors without so much heat that I begin to loose the ability to taste all those wonderful layers of tastes.It is another exceptionally brilliant idea to put the salt in yet another separate pouch. Again, my wife does not like very much salt at all, so I don't put any in while cooking. I salt my bowl-full with some sea-salt, and in my opinion a little sea-salt REALLY brings out the complex flavors in this chili mix. I hope more products begin to put the salt in a separate packet. I think most folks would be appalled to see exactly how much salt is in the average meal-mix they buy: like Hamburger Helper for example. Plus for some reason good sea salt just tastes better than the cheap salt.Lastly, Mr. Shelby puts a packet of thickening powder in his kit - in addition to the main chili pack, the cayenne packet, and the salt packet. The thickening agent is simply finely ground corn meal and it does a nice job of thickening the chili if that is what you like and prefer. I have prepared this kit many times both with and without the thickening, and I like it both ways. I now just alternate for variety.PREPARATION TIPS from my personal preferences:*Saute LOTS of onion to go in the chili. At lease one large yellow onion, and I sometimes do one-and-a-half.*Always use the optional 15oz can of diced tomatoes (don't forget to reduce the amount of water used, like the direction on the box say.*Always use the optional 15oz can of beans. My favorite are dark kidney beans, but greatly enjoy black-beans, pintos, or about any chili-style bean. TIP: drain the liquid from the can of beans into a bowl, and use the liquid as substitute for part of the ""water"" called for in the recipe.*Some favorite toppings in the bowl: sea salt, cayenne powder, diced white onions, pepper jack or cheddar cheese, black olives, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, tortilla chips.I will address some of the complaints by negative reviewers:1)A few said the chili was not very flavorful. Unfortunately in the USA most folks confuse ""salt"" with flavor. Since the mix has separate salt packet and none in the mix, I believe that nay-sayers have just not put in the prodigious amount of extra salt that they are used to associating with ""flavor"". As I wrote earlier, the chili benefits from some sea salt, but for my taste, does not need large amounts.2)Some may say the lack of heat is not flavorful enough. Well, there are folks who like things thermo-nuclear-hot, and you just can't get there with the little extra cayenne packet supplied in the kit. The chili with no cayenne at all is slightly warm, and varying amounts of the cayenne powder will satisfy the tastes of 99.999% of folks. For those who like more heat, add whatever crazy-hot stuff you require to get the heat you want.3)If your complaint is that it does not taste exactly like you want right out of the box (like some other brand perhaps), I disagree strongly, because I believe that the customization offered by the different pouches included, is a greatly beneficial feature. If they made it to taste exactly like YOU want, then it probably wouldn't taste like many other folks want.",5,"Delicious Chili Kit with Lots of Flexible Customization Options",1292457600,"2014-12-18"

At our house we avoid MSG because my husband is very allergic to it, and that means we usually have to avoid processed foods, and most packaged foods like this.

Two kits and four pounds of venison is just the right amount for us.

Just let it simmer in the spices until it's tender and juicy, then add the cayenne, masa slurry and some of the salt..... give it 20 minutes to thicken up (add a bit more beer if it's too thick for your taste.Top with raw minced onion and cotijo cheese, crumbled fine, a couple of thin slices of raw jalapeno for crunch and a hunk of hot water corn breadon the side bread.....Divine!That's the best part about having the components all seperate..

The directions are very consise and clear, and it just tastes great.  I like the fact that all of the spices and flour are kept in separate packest, allowing you to make the chili exactly the way YOU like it.  Personally, I like a thicker chili which is flaming hot, so I end up using everything in the package as well as adding a minced habanero and chunks of beef.  If you add a bit of tomato paste before anything else, you will end up with a very flavorful chili.  You just need a tablespoon.

I still use it sometimes, but it's nowhere close to the taste of the ""original"" kit:-(",3,"Was my favourite, but something happened to it...",1327968000,"2014-12-18"
"B000H23Z1C","I used to love making chili using this kit, but something has changed in the mix. When the mix came in the bag, it was fantastic, but since they changed from the bag to the box, it's awful. Earlier this summer, I contacted the company and they were very nice; sent me a couple of coupons, but still I don't like the mix now. I contacted the company because when I made the chili using the mix, the chili was gritty as if the mix had beach sand in it. A few days ago, I bought two boxes of the mix. I made a pot of chili and again, the chili was gritty like sand. I had to throw out the pot of chili.  I then took the second box and mixed it with plain water and cooked it. Again, it was so gritty it was like chewing beach sand. So I know it wasn't something in the meat or in the tomato sauce. I checked the box for a Lot Number, but there isn't one on the box. The Best By Date is Nov 24 2012. Maybe the last two boxes I bought came from the same Lot as the ones I bought earlier this summer. Overall, I will have to scout for a different chili mix. The quality of this mix is not what it used to be.",1,"Something has changed about this chili mix",1349827200,"2014-12-18"
"B000H23Z1C","Very easy to prepare, and you can modify it with your own favorite ingredients too.  It's my go to dish for large parties, and it runs out every single time!

"B000H23Z1C","I love using this spice mix for making all kinds of chili -- vegetarian, beef, turkey, chicken. The base spice mix is only mildly spicy but there is a smaller bag with cayenne pepper to kick it up several notches. We serve it with additional  hot sauces at the table for those who like to really crank up the heat. When I first started using this product, I followed the recipe on the back. Now I only use it as a rough guideline, sauteing onions, peppers, garlic (as the mood strikes me) and then adding that back to the cooked meat. I also use this as a crock pot meal on days when I know my afternoon will be particularly busy.",5,"Love this spice mix",1354233600,"2014-12-18"
"B000H23Z1C","There are many chili mixes out there you can buy that will help you make a decent pot of chili. But there is only one chili Kit around that makes an excellent pot of chili and it is the only one I will use when my family wants chili for dinner, Carroll Shelby's Original Texas Chili Kit.What makes it stand out from the rest is because it is a kit it gives you the ability to variate how you want to make your chili. In addition to the packet that has all the needed spices to make chili it also includes packets with salt, cayenne pepper and a masa powder that can be used to thicken the chili if you like it that way. With these packets you make the chili as hot or as mild as you want it and as salted as you like it.From there you can be creative and add your own ingredients to any way you want. The box on the back has suggestions on what you can do to make the chili different. But try to be creative on your own with the help of this kit. Most times I try to do something a little different in making my chili. One thing I like to do sometimes is only use one pound of lean ground beef instead of two as the directions says and add a pound of ground pork. I find it adds a subtle change to the flavor of the chili that works well. No matter how you want to make yours just try this chili kit once and I will bet you will never want to use any other chili mix again.",5,"First Rate Chili Kit",1393027200,"2014-12-18"

"B000H23Z1C","This dandy chili mix makes great chili. It is one of the best things I have tasted in a long time. It has a clever concept, which explains why it is a `kit'. The bag has 4 separate packets: a main chile packet (the chili powder has almost no heat, but lots of flavor), a small packet of cayenne, a small packet of salt, and a larger one with masa harina. This way, you adjust the heat, salt, and thickness to your liking; some chile mixes has everything combined, and you cannot change it. One kit is enough for 2 pounds of meat, so larger batches will require more kits.Course, I did not follow the included recipe. I tossed the salt (I used sea salt instead) and masa flour (it was plenty thick without it) packets, used beef chuck cut into 1  inch cubes instead of ground beef (course, it took that much longer to cook, but so what?), and all of the cayenne packet. Boy was it good.",5,"Best Chili Ever",1174867200,"2014-12-18"

"B000H23Z1C","I've been using this Carroll Shelby chili mix for years, but finding it in local stores has been hit or miss.  It had gotten to where I was buying several packages at a time whenever I could find it anywhere.I was amazed to find it here on Amazon, and for considerably less than I've paid in stores in the past.  I love chili, and usually make 1-2 batches per month during the winter, and at least a batch every couple of months during the summer.There's a recipe on the package, but I don't know anyone who actually follows it to the letter.  I suppose if you've never made chili before, it's a good starting place.  You can then decide how you might want to modify it.I usually use half ground beef and half ground turkey (approx. a pound of each), a chopped onion, a 28-oz can of ""redi-cut"" tomatoes, a small can of tomato paste, a small can of black beans, a small can of pinto beans; then, from the chili kit, I add the spice packet and the entire cayenne pepper packet.  They used to include a tiny bottle of tabasco sauce; they discontinued that in favor of the cayenne.  I like things a little spicy, and the amount of cayenne here makes for a low-medium ""burn"" level.Only occasionally do I find I need to use the masa flour.  Usually, my chili is thick enough without it.Finally, I top it with shredded colby-jack cheese, and serve it with cornbred muffins.  We're talking serious yum here.It makes amazing chili dogs, too.  And chili mac.  And chili cornbread casserole (thicken the chili a little, put it in a square baking dish, top with dollops of cornbread batter, bake at 350 until cornbread is puffed and starting to brown).Carroll Shelby's mix has just the right combination of spices to make the best tasting chili I've ever had.  I'll so glad that it's available right here on Amazon.",5,"This makes INCREDIBLE chili!",1234396800,"2014-12-18"
"B000H23Z1C","I have tried all of the chili seasoning available at the supermarkets and this is the best - believe me! I saute an onion first; then add 2 pounds of ground beef and then a can of diced tomatoes with juice, a large can of tomato sauce and the Shelby seasoning (but not the extra cayene!) and water to thin if you like it a bit soupy. In fact, this is mt main dish for Superbowl Sunday! We serve it with additional fresh chopped onions and grated longhorn cheese as a final garnish. Yum!",4,"best-ever chili seasoning",1265414400,"2014-12-18"
"B000H23Z1C","Honestly, if you've never tried this chili, do. It's so easy and SO tasty. You can make it hot or mild very easily. I use about 1/3 of the chili packet, and it's pretty spicy to me - so don't just dump in the whole packet. Put some in, mix it up, and give it a taste before adding more. Takes about 30 minutes start to finish, and I think the leftovers are even better than the first night because the flavors have had more time to blend. See if you can find it in your local store and try a pack first, but if you do, this is a great way to always have it on hand, and at a very good price per box.",5,"Really good chili, really fast",1386115200,"2014-12-18"

"B000H23Z1C","I'm on the website today to order a second twelve-pack of this mix.  I haven't shopped around a lot; Carroll Shelby's is the first and only mix I've tried, and I'm very happy with it.  I found it on Amazon earlier this year after being unable to find it in local stores, and I've just recently gone through the first twelve-pack (okay, I gave one pack to my mother-in-law).I've converted my daughter and my mother-in-law to it, as well; they're both chili lovers and we use this recipe together with dark red kidney beans, diced tomatoes, a small can of tomato sauce, and ground turkey (healthier, and cheaper, and there's a small difference in texture and none in taste from ground beef).  We recommend going with the recipe option that calls for a large can of diced tomatoes, and about half the cayenne packet, and about 32 oz of canned dark red kidney beans, drained (the recipe only recommends 16 oz), and between 2 and 3 lbs of ground whatever.Ground beef, not too lean, or chopped chuck, or cubed pot roast are all good candidates for the meat.  As the package used to say, fifteen years ago, don't waste your money on expensive cuts of beef here.The directions are pretty basic and perfectly adequate to produce a good hearty meal.  Use a _big_ frying pan, 13"" if you've got one, and have a larger stew pot/saucepan of some kind standing by in case your ingredients are too much for the pan.  Do stir frequently once you've added the spices and flour, because there's some tendency for the mix to thicken up and form a skin on the bottom of the pot, and you'll lose good flavor that way (not to mention the bottom might get burned and ruin the whole recipe).With 2-3 lbs of meat, two cans of beans and a large (28 oz) can of diced tomatoes in tomato juice, the whole thing makes six or seven _really_ generous portions (12-14 oz each).  I make it and freeze most of it in individual portions, taking it in to work and microwaving it at lunch.",5,"Ordering it again!",1222905600,"2014-12-18"

Thinking we might have made a mistake with the first batch, we gave it another try, a few weeks later.

THe chili is still &#34;ok&#34;  -- better than the competition I've tried. However; this Chili used to be GREAT.  Award winning great.  It probably didn't appeal to as many people because it was true texas style take no prisoners spicy chew your beef chili.  I guess I can't blame them for trying to increase their market.

We like it real spicy. As for the comment from one of the others that said this does not taste like real chili they are completely wrong. If you just eat canned chili then you will probably not like this. This is not meant to taste sweet if you want a sweet chili stick with your canned or I guess you can add some brown sugar. We eat nothing but this chili and will never change that. We make a huge batch so that way we can freeze it and at the end of a long work day we can still have bread bowls with chili or chili dogs.

"B000H23Z1C","I've been eating chili made with this since I was a kid, so for me, this is how chili is supposed to taste.In my family, growing up, Mom did most of the cooking. Except tacos, chili and barbecue which my dad did. My dad, a bit of a racing fan, always got this kind of chili mix for chili. He would make it with chuck steak ground into thick meaty chunks, tomato sauce and use just a touch of the cayenne,half the salt, a bit of the thickener, and the chili flavor packet. Mom would make corn bread to go with it. The chili was served topped with cheese and onions with a thick slice of cornbread on the side dripping with honey and butter. My brother and I both loved chili night.Skip forward to my adult years and my marriage, I explained to my husband one day that I wanted chili for dinner. He said we would get the things to make, and I told him ""Dad always made the chili. I don't know how to, so you have to make the chili."" He replied that he didn't know how to make chili, so I explained to him how to make it and told him what kind of seasoning to get. The same sort Dad always got. Now it's in boxes instead of brown bags, but it still tastes the same.We make it to our tastes, and both of us make the chili. If I make it, I saut&eacute; a large onion then put in a lb of ground turkey and brown it. Then I add a large can of tomato puree and a can of kidney beans, and mix in the full chili packet, put the salt aside for popcorn another night, a bit of the masa thickener, and a pinch of cayenne and let it simmer for an hour. When my husband makes it, he makes it with very lean ground beef, tomato sauce, kidney beans, chili packet and a bit more pepper than I use, sometimes adding bell peppers and onions in while it's simmering. We usually serve it with tortillas on the side and topped with a sharp cheddar.And my teens love chili night as much as I did when I was younger.",5,"It's how it's supposed to taste",1284249600,"2014-12-18"

It used to include oregano and a third chile powder - guajillo, I think, and if you left the red pepper out it was not hot because the main powder was all ancho. I tried making a mild version for my father in law who had a hankering during his recovery from heart surgery and couldn't do it. Even leaving all the red pepper out it was too hot.

"B000H2998U","Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili Kit, 3.625-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) is the best quality and most consistent chili mix ever. And this twelve pack is a bargain.I live in France, and when I want to make ""real Texas chili"" for my French friends I use Wick's, make it with stew meat, and serve it with plenty of corn tortillas. They always complain about the heat, but invariably eat more, and then want the recipe.I think the secret is keeping each ingredient in its own packet until you cook. The chili is seperate from the oregano is sepeperate from the cumin is separate from the red pepper is separate from the salt, each in their own packet. In the Carol Shelby competing product, it is just one spice packet you dump in. I think all the spices sitting next to each other begin to cancel each others flavors out on the shelf, whereas with Wick's they don't even meet up until your meat and onions have been sauteed.I have been using Wick's for 34 years, and every other chili mix I've tried has always failed to live up to this high quality, consistent product that well deserves its fabulous reputation among those who know their chili. Other than hand roasting your own ingredients from scratch, this is the best ready-made chili mix kit there is.",5,"Best quality and most consistent chili mix ever.",1316304000,"2014-12-18"

"B000H2998U","I did a head-to-head comparison between this product and the competing Carroll Shelby kit; Wick Fowler came out ahead by a significant margin. WF had a deeper red color and more ""three dimensional"" flavor, whereas the CS was more brown and tasted mostly of cumin (smoky) instead of the full flavor of WF. I'd definitely recommend using beer instead of some of the water; I also add a can of tomatoes when I make it. The only downside to this particular deal is that Amazon's price is higher than my local store, but if it's not available locally to you, this would be a good buy.",5,"Very good for a quick bowl of red",1240185600,"2014-12-18"

We've been making it consistently for 20 years. He likes it with ground buffalo meat, says it's a tiny bit sweet. It's also great with half ground turkey or beef and half pork. Adding a whole sauteed diced onion is a must. We add stewed tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, olives, chili and kidney beans. Right, we're not from Texas. But it is excellent with some chunks of steak.

Prepared exactly according to specs, it's a very good chili.  With a little minor tweaking, it's epic.It's much, much cheaper to buy this product at Amazon than it is by me, where the packages run about $4 each.",5,"Is it the best chili in the known universe?

"B000H2998U","I'll admit that I modify the procedure from the instructions.  That is one of the beauties of the Kit.  I use ground buffalo instead of beef, delete the table salt in favor of a salt substitute, use organic tomatoes, include tomato paste, chopped red onion, and sometimes substitute mushrooms at the halfway cooking point for the beans.  This gives a satisfactory 'tooth' to the finished Chili when you desire a change.  You, the cook, can do whatever you want to tune the chili to the way you desire.  Now, I like the full 2 Alarm 'bite'.  I want my forehead to break out in a slight sweat as I finish a bowl.  You may prefer the 1 Alarm level. or even the baby &#34;False Alarm&#34; version (Shudder!)  The instructions tell you how to achieve that as well.

"B000H2998U","I may get serious about cooking... but sometimes we find ourselves standing in the grocery store and wondering what the heck to make tonight. For at least 20 years one of my most reliable standbys has been the Wick Fowler 2-Alarm chili -- largely because it tastes good, is natural (no sugar or other junk -- just spices), is very cheap, and can be thrown together with almost no effort. It also reheats very well the next day, so this is ""convenience food"" for us busy foodies.One of the reasons I like this mix is that it's very customizable. All the spices are supplied in individual packets, so you can adjust the heat by adding just a little of the ""hot"" chile (though even at the 2-alarm level it's not *super*spicy), or go light on the salt, etc. The basic mix calls for you to add 2 pounds of ground beef, an 8-oz can of tomato sauce, and two 8-oz cans of water. With the instructions' encouragement we usually add a can of pinto beans, too, and a can of diced tomatoes; we also substitute an amber ale for the water. See: It can be as complex as you want it to be. But cooking is simple: Brown the meat, dump in everything else, and simmer for half an hour. Add the masa packet at the end if you feel like it (and we usually do). Dinner's served.And did I mention this is delicious? Sure, I can spend an afternoon making a pot-o-red from scratch that's better than this. But this is darned tasty stuff that takes almost no time.

My husband is a chili fanatic, and he'll add lots more heat in his bowl, like chopped habaneros. I like the recommendations of adding beer, and have also been tempted to add cocoa to give it that Mexican mole taste. A little red wine is also good.

"B000H2998U","My favorite Chili kit.  My only advice for ya YANKEES - this is Tex Mex chili.  It may (almost certainly) be &#34;hotter&#34; than what you are used to.  You can always add more of the Cayenne Pepper; once it's in the chili mix; it's pretty touch to take out.  So, my advice is to make the chili without it - taste it, and then GRADUALLY add the Cayenne Pepper until it's at the level you want.  You may find that you don't use any - nothing to feel bad about.  Cayenne isn't for everyone.Make some corn bread - again, my personal recommendation is to make up some of the Jiffy brand corn bread mix - then add a tablespoonful of Vanilla.  The vanilla will add flavor and really makes ordinary cornbread something special, and it works perfectly with this chili.",5,"Fast, delicious and best yet ... season to your taste!!",1384819200,"2014-12-18"

"B000H2998U","My supermarket quit stocking Fowlers 2 Alarm Chili mix. I was delighted to find it here. My recipe for mild chili for my family isIngredients- 3 pounds lean ground beef- 2 packages 2 Alarm chili mix, Do NOT use the red pepper-  3 TBS olive oil- 2 bay leaves- 1 32 oz can chopped tomatoes- 1 large onions diced-  1/2 sweet green pepper roughly chopped- 5 cloves garlic finely diced- 1 can red kidney beans, drained- 2 bottles real good beerIn a dutch oven, brown meat and pour off fat. Saute onions,green pepper and garlic in a skillet in olive oil. Saute until onions are translucent. Then add all to ground beef.  Add all other ingredients and simmer until done. then add one beer and drink the other one.Enjoy",5,"Best Chili",1298592000,"2014-12-18"
"B000H2998U","I expected to like this mix based on its reviews.  The seasonings had almost no scent when the packets were opened, except the chili powder--and that had an unappealingly dusty scent.  I thought that the flavors would emerge and improve during cooking, but it cooked up the same way.  The dominant taste was a sharp, bitter, dry, almost burnt, very old and dusty flavor.  Cumin, oregano, garlic, onion, all the flavors that round out a typical chili seasoning blend were undetectable.  The heat level was perfect; I used half the red pepper packet and it was a true medium-hot level.  But the overwhelming flavor was not of warm, deep, rich, pleasant chili.  It tasted of something more akin to a library full of mildewy books that had burned, then had been ground up and added to dried chiles. I usually make chili with my own recipe and homemade New Mexico red chile sauce, but I also use and like a variety of chili seasoning packets and chili-starter sauces.  I've never tasted chili that was so close to being inedible.I may have gotten a rare bad box, and I'm giving it two stars instead of one to account for that possibility.  I bought this at my local Kroger, which routinely sells food past its sell-by date including meat, fish, and dairy--so I now carefully check the dates of everything I buy there.  This box's expiration date was nearly a year from now, but maybe it had a misadventure during travel and storage.  Otherwise, it's a mystery.",2,"Very disappointing",1351382400,"2014-12-18"

Because this is just the spices, and because each of the spices is separately packeted in this kit, I can adjust as needed, and it lets me make the chili my own concoction, varying the meats, beans, tomatoes, etc. that go to make up the chili.

"B000H2998U","North, South, East & West...cooks took no prisoners at the World's Championship Chili Cook-off. Wick Fowler, walked away with 1st place, the coveted bronze chili pot. His 2 Alarm Chili will go down in history as the best bowl of chili for the inaugural 1970 championship.  The nice thing about this commercial product is you get many different individual sealed packets of all the ingredients freely identified so you can customize to personal preference.  The quality of each ingredient is very high tier, as good if not better than a named national brand of spice.  The roasted ground chili pepper packet in particular is better than anything I have found elsewhere.  I personally use three pounds of ground sirloin steak and the full pack of red pepper, not the two pounds of meat recommended, as with two pounds it comes out a tad too spicy for my taste unless you leave out the red pepper.  This kit has been around a long time and is at most markets west of the Rockies, out here in California we need to order it by the case of 12 through Amazon.  The Internet is full of variations on the classic recipe, my personal favorite being a double batch, 2 kits, with two large onions and five yellow bell peppers cooked in with four pounds of meat, 2 pounds of kidney beans, and 2 pounds of tomato puree.  Word to the wise, use some form of commercial chicken or pork stock, never water.  The changed the instructions over the years to 20 min. of boiling and less water, I prefer the old method of one quart of stock (single recipe) and slow 2 hour boil until reduced.

I've tried several different chili spice types to make it from scratch and what I;ve found is it costs more and no chili powder is as good as Wick's.

About 10 or 15 years ago we found it in a Dillons store here in town.

I must be very sensitive to it, as only **15 mini-chips** had this effect.  But in case any of you are also sensitive souls, thought I'd share this tip to keep the insomnia at bay.The only other thing - for some reason it caused my chocolate cake to have a waxy finish.  We didn't mind it, but in case some of you are real bakers...Nonetheless, happy these exist.",3,"Nice flavor. Weird Waxy finish.

"B000HDJZWO","These &#34;Enjoy Life&#34; mini chips are fantastic in chocolate chip cookies. There is absolutely no difference in these chips over the other popular brands sold in the markets today. Generally speaking, I find them much better, and a whole lot healthier as well for those on a restricted diet like mine.  I like knowing the product is truly clean of all the added preservatives I do not need to pour into my body or my family's.  I also find them as a, &#34;guilt free&#34; treat.

We use these to bake with, make fudge, make smores, snacking, making our own trail mix, and many others. The price on Amazon is by far the best bargain too. Our local market sells each bag for $5.69 and if I run out accidentally I will pay that price, but it pains me to do it. I got 6 bags from Amazon for what I would pay for 3 bags at the local store.

Just ask my Mum.And what is so remarkable about this is that my cookies are gluten-free and vegan, meaning I make them without wheat, eggs, butter, milk or milk products.  I also do not use refined sugar but a few drops of liquid vanilla stevia instead.  Now mind you, my Mum is not gluten intolerant; nor is she vegan.  And she is famous in our family for her sweet tooth. Yet she adores my chocolate chip cookies anyway and always loves it when I bring her a batch still warm from the oven!What is my secret?  It has to be these Enjoy Life chocolate chips!I grew up on Nestle's semi-sweet chocolate chips and Mum always made her brood of us six kids the tollhouse cookie recipe on the back of the Nestle package.  I have a 60 year history with Nestle's chips and I never met a chocolate chip cookie made with them that I didn't love.  But truth be told they and most traditional chocolate chip cookie recipes haven't had a place in my diet for several decades.  Serious food allergies as well as gluten intolerance have restricted my diet greatly.  It's been torture for my own sweet tooth, believe me.But now thanks to these fantastic Enjoy Life chocolate chips and a great gluten-free vegan cookie recipe, I am back in cookie heaven.These chips are tiny but I like that about them.  They are also quite sweet and I like that too. No, I LOVE that sweetness!I really love to bake, especially cookies, and Enjoy Life allergy friendly chocolate chips are a staple in my pantry. I can find these chocolate chips at my local supermarkets but they run from between $5 and $6 a package.

Being free of many common allergens is also great and I wish mainstream food producers would reevaluate the many substances they put in our food, often in the name of higher profits. Maybe you agree with this, maybe you don't, but these chips speak for themselves when you taste them. Do yourself a favor, eat more raw foods, give up meat, drink young coconut water (available on Amazon), eat steel cut oats, exercise daily, don't go near a television or the Internet (except for Amazon.com), spend lots of time outdoors, treat animals with reverence and eat cookies made with these chips.

These mini chips were really tiny- smaller than typical &#34;mini chips&#34;. I just used more in my baking and that worked just fine. I definitely recommend these- a much &#34;cleaner&#34; chocolate that has all the quality and flavor as other less-healthy chocolate brands (nestle, ghiradelli, etc).",5,"Small but great!",1397520000,"2015-08-28"
"B000HDJZWO","This past Christmas I was challenged with the task of baking cookies for lactose-intolerant family members, one of whom also has nut allergies.  At first it seemed easy -- just use margarine instead of butter and leave out the nuts!  But I soon discovered that the vast majority of chocolate products contain dairy (even dark chocolate chips), and they are almost all manufactured in facilities that also process nuts.  So in an attempt to avoid a holiday disaster, I took to the Internet to find a solution.These ENJOY LIFE CHOCOLATE CHIPS are guaranteed dairy and nut free.  I was a little worried that they wouldn't taste as good as the chips I'm used to (Nestle Toll House, mainly).  So when they arrived, I quickly ripped open one of the bags and popped a few chips into my mouth.  They are absolutely delicious.  The chocolate is rich and smooth, with a lovely, almost creamy flavor.  I liked them better than any packaged chips I have ever used.My only complaint (and it's not really a complaint at all) is that these are ""mini-chips,"" which are actually smaller than I'd like them to be.  ENJOY LIFE does sell a larger, chunky chip for baking, but they seemed too big.  I wish they made standard size chips to use in cookies.  That said, I must admit the flavor of the chips in the cookies was good enough to compensate for the smaller size.  Everyone who tasted them said they were the best chocolate chip cookies they had ever eaten!I recommend these highly.  You do have to buy six bags (which is a problem if you don't do a lot of baking), but since I can't find these in local stores I'm just glad to have found an easy place to buy them.  Excellent product.",5,"Amazingly fabulous dark chocolate chips",1358294400,"2015-08-28"

"B000HDJZWO","I hit 21 and for some reason started developing food allergies left and right.  Several years later and there are so many foods, including (but not limtited to)all tree nuts, sunflower and safflower seeds/oil, oats, red berries and sulfates, that set me off terribly and with increasing sensitivity.Chocolate seemed to be one of the new aggressors and I've been trying to tough it out with carob, but it just doesn't cut it for me.I had an epiphany when I saw these in the store and wondered it could possibly be all the junk chocolate can get processed with or shared equiptment that was setting me off.Success!! I tried a little, waited, nothing happened. Repeated the next day  with a couple of table spoons and again, no excema, throat swelling or digestive problems, which never hesitate to make them selves known if I have a problem with a food.NOT that I recomend trial and error to people who think they are allergic to anything, though that IS what my doctors came up with for my specific case, and I'm really exicited that I didn't react.Going to probably buy these in bulk and try not to go crazy after 3 months of trying to like carob!Seriously though, in the non-allergic epoch of my life, I was a chocolate snob.  If I wanted chocolate I would splurge on a three dollar bar of the good stuff and avoided Hersey's like the plague.

"B000HDJZWO","One of our kids is pretty sensitive to soy, and these are the only chocolate chips I have found that don't contain soy. I have been using them for a couple of years, and they work great in any recipe that calls for chocolate chips. I actually think they taste better than &#34;regular&#34; chocolate chips...a few weeks ago, I bought a bag of Ghirardelli chips (which are supposed to be top-notch), and they didn't even taste good compared to these. The only thing I don't like about them is that they are mini chips, not full-sized ones, and there are some recipes where I want bigger chips. But, that's a small gripe. I will gladly continue to pay exorbitant prices for these because they are free of allergens without being full of junk.",5,"Best chocolate chips ever!",1398988800,"2015-08-28"

It is hard to find a chocolate that does not have milk or any type of dairy in it. When you get lucky enough to find one it usually is processed in a plant that processes dairy or tree nuts (another allergy). I was so happy to find these chips.

My daughter breaks out if she eats too much soy, and pretty much all chocolate uses soy lecithin as an emulsifier instead of cocoa butter, as true chocolate should have.  But it's a cost savings.  But it makes it hard to find stuff without soy in it, so this product is a blessing.

At first that took a little getting used to, but that also makes them quite versatile for tossing in to recipes where you just want a hint of chocolate, baking oatmeal-chocolate chip cookies, snacking right out of the bag, and for melting very quickly in the microwave when needed (perfect for a quick dipping fondue, or mixing the melted chips with just a touch of oil and then swirling a few dollops of sunbutter and eating when cooled/hardened).Although I started buying these chips a couple of years ago due to one family member's multiple food allergies, everyone in the family totally loves these chips and I would still buy them even if there were no food allergy issues: we all like them that much.",5,"The BEST chips ever and so versatile!",1236816000,"2015-08-28"

There are so many things you can do with them other than the mainstay of including them in homemade cookies. I melt them and put in crushed peppermints for peppermint bark, or a rice cereal to make a generic &#34;Crunch&#34; bar, and even melt them down to make jam- or pistachio nut-butter-filled chocolates.They are really versatile, and, best of all, they don't get grainy even after being melted and re-cooled, which is an amazing thing for soy-lecithin-free chocolate.

"B000HDJZWO","The title says it all for me. I wanted these for baking! If they don't tell you, or you couldn't tell from the photo, these are MINI-CHOCOLATE CHIPS! My bags didn't have the words ""Mini Chips"", and no picture, so the manufacturer is in the process of learning/updating. They taste good/fine/chocolately when you eat them out of the bag. But, when you bake them into cookies, be prepared to make a smaller batch(use less flour, etc.), or use more than one bag! I was REALLY disappointed! I couldn't taste them at all! Because of how they tasted in hand, I thought they would be fine, but most recipes call for 2 cups chocolate chips = 1 bag of chocolate chips. Those are 12 oz bags. These are 10 oz bags.  Who measures?? Well, I didn't measure. I think if I had used maybe 1 1/2 to 2 bags it might of been okay.Okay, so I didn't react soy-wise, but.... what's the good of being rid of the reactive element if you get rid of the flavor and enjoyment at the same time?! I might as  well done plain cookies in that case! Or shortbread, then I wouldn't of expected chocolate-chip flavor, ya know?!?If you can find the ""right"" bag of Dagoba (Organic Chocolate) Chocodrops 73% cacao content, in the baking section, read the label [one bag HAD soy lecithin; the other one from another store didn't-of course I bought it, and they really didn't have the soy lecithin, how odd. April 2011], they are a much better choice, choco chip size-wise. The Dagoba's were an accident find. Unfortunately, these are only 8 oz. (not 12), but the flavor stands up to the baking. You probably want to add vanilla to complement. * I got mine from Whole Food's Market. This isn't something you typically find at Safeway or Lucky's Market, FYI.I will make it a point to re-bake using two bags and see what happens and add a comment",4,"No soy.

It's not overly salty like so many products, and you can see actual pieces of basil in it. It has a slightly mint undertone, but it compliments the basil.

In my local store, 1 envelope can be $2-3, and not always available, so this is a much better deal (12 packets for $15.51 plus super saver shipping) for a product we use weekly.  If you like the Knorr brand (contains dairy), you will probably like this.  However, if you are picky about your pesto (use only jarred/fresh, make-your-own) this may disappoint, you should buy just 1 packet to try from your local store before you purchase a bulk item, but it pleases my family.** If you have corn allergy/intolerance, this product is not for you.

It is pretty much a blank slate. Can be eaten as a hot cereal or a cold cereal, and it's crunchy and hearty enough that it could probably go in yogurt as a granola substitute, too.

It tastes like wood now and sometimes, I can taste some pesticide.  I called Amazon to return all 12 boxes, and they immediately replaced them without any hassle.  However, once I got the new boxes and opened them, it tasted the same, quite awful.  I called Food For Life and let them know about the taste change and a lady said that she would bring it to the manufacturers attention.  I also have a twin brother in California who also said the taste has changed.  Then, I went to Whole Food Market to see if the same problem was occuring with the cereal in the store.

"B000LKYX48","For anyone interested in eating food that is truly good for you in every aspect, Ezekiel 4:9 Golden Flax is the answer.  When you study the digestive system you begin to understand that our bodies do not like processed foods, the words ""enriched flour"" should send you running in the oppposite direction.  Our bodies cannot digest white flour, yet how many of our products today have that as a major ingredient.  This cereal is made for a unique natural processing method that uses live sprouted grains and bakes them in loaves in order to then produce the cereal.  Your body loves it!  My husband was raised on the classic southern diet of white - white breads, white gravies, white rice.

"B000LKYX48","I believe that those who bash the flavor of this product are generally used to eating processed products and have yet to acquire the taste of natural grains.  Once you learn how to eat healthier, it's amazing how most people learn how naturally sweet dry toast can be if its made with a really great bread or how wonderful this cereal is.For my taste, I love this stuff andd I think it's worth every dime.  The boxes are always stuffed to capacity without the three or four inches of dead space chalked up as ""settling due to shipping and handling"".  I normally add it on top of a bowl of fresh fruit and yogurt and then listen to my co-workers tell me how great my breakfast or lunch looks.Anyway, I highly recommend Food For Life Ezekiel cereal - its very difficult to find more nutrition in a single meal anywhere else!",5,"Really great cereal",1186704000,"2013-03-01"
"B000LKYX48","I've used Ezekiel 4:9 bread for a lot of years and enjoyed its no-flour, high-nutrient goodness. But it's not easy to find decent cereal...most of them are high-salt, high-sugar, do-it-yourself health problems in a box.Was great to find E4:9's cereals! I've tried the flax and the cinnamon-raisin...both are great! Most of the time, I eat it cold with almond milk. But sometimes, I like mixing E4:9 about half 'n half with oat bran (I use Bob's Red Mill), adding almond milk, and popping it in the microwave for about three minutes. This stuff is great hot!One great thing besides knowing the cereal is crammed with nutrition and high fiber is that it fills you up but good...and sticks to your ribs for hours. A real help for losing weight.Some people won't like this kind of cereal. Too much like chowing down on twigs and weeds and sawdust, they fear. But the flavor is truly enjoyable. Add the milk, some fruit, and you'll have energy to last!Finally, I've compared local store prices against Amazon, and the local is far higher.",5,"Super Great Stuff!",1304294400,"2013-03-01"

I was used to cereals with high sugar content and this tasted like cardboard. After two weeks of eating it nearly every morning, all that has changed.

"B000LKYX48","I love ""Food for Life Ezekiel"" products. Originally, I was introduced to the bread when on a special diet -- an offshoot program of ""Over-eaters Anonymous"", the H.O.W. program -- many years ago. The bread contains NO flour, no sugar, is high in protein and fiber, and, for my taste, is delicious. Actually, I learned that OVER-eating was not really my problem. My problem was NOT eating the healthiest, life-giving, minimally processed foods available. Over time, I learned, relapsed, and relearned, etc. I was thrilled when I learned ""Food for Life"" added cereals to their product line. In looking at labels at my local health food store, I discovered that this brand was the ONLY cold cereal on the shelves that had NO sugar content! Since then, this is the ONLY cold cereal I buy. It can be served warm, as well. Generally, though, I prefer ""John McCann's Steel-Cut Irish Oatmeal"" (also zero sugar and high fiber) for hot cereal.Needless to say, the cereal is expensive (but cheap if you consider that you're no longer polluting your body with all the sugar, air, preservatives, and other junk in most commercial cereals), so I was thrilled to find that Amazon.com offered it in a 6-box bundle for a far better price than my local market. I usually have a bowl a day with fresh berries (strawberries are very sweet this year in my area) and slivered almonds topped with light soy milk.  I find that when I'm eating really nutritious food, I eat slowly and savor. When I'm eating junk, I tend to ""wolf"" it down. It doesn't matter why. I just hate that sensation, so I avoid it and my body thanks me every day.",5,"Healthy, delicious, and at a decent price.",1183766400,"2013-03-01"

"B000LKYX48","I ordered the six box package since the reviews were almost uniformly positive. I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed after eating the first small bowl, but I think that was just because the flavor was different than I expected. At that point I was thinking that I just bought way too much of this cereal. After eating a few more bowls I've really grown to enjoy it. It's pretty amazing for a cereal with no sugar. I'm going to try some of the serving suggestions I've read in the other reviews here just to see what it's like with a touch of sweetness, but I enjoy it with just milk.",4,"Pretty tasty",1240704000,"2013-03-01"

"B000PXZZQG","After going through the Amazon checkout, I awaited my delivery of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese with great anticipation. In fact, as I waited, I became quite impatient and actually strangled a homeless man. It wasn't my finest hour, nor is it something I'm proud of. Regardless, I rather quickly descended into a life a crime and drug abuse. But soon, the UPS man delivered my order; I was ecstatic! I quickly made the macaroni & cheese, keeping strictly to the directions on the box. I did have a little trouble trying to get the packet of cheese out of the little, perforated hole out of which the macaroni is poured, but it only proved to be a temporary setback to my redemption. Upon completion of the meal, I fell into a pool of joy as the warm, cheesy elbow macaroni noodles slid down my throat and into my stomach. Suddenly, I found myself free from my drug addiction! I couldn't believe it; all my withdrawal symptoms disappeared quicker than Judy Winslow from ""Family Matters."" I then said to myself, ""If this can do that for me, I wonder what other wrongs I can correct. I found the homeless man I had earlier killed and force fed the mac & cheese to him. Much to my surprise, he soon revived and thanked me for the meal, as that's all he had ever wanted. He later became a successful businessman, and has only the mac & cheese to thank for it. After fixing all the problems I had caused, I ate the last spoonful of mac & cheese. Not long after mastication, Publisher's Clearing House showed up to my front door with a check for $5 million!

"B000UCOQV2","I just began usingGolden Barrel Blackstrap Molasses - 16 fl oz (single)and I must agree that it isn't enough time to know whether it works or not. However, I remember that as a young boy my mom took me to the doctor and he recommended a similar product for an anemic condition. Many years have passed since, but I still remember its taste, though this particular brand does not have that strong iron taste. This product shows an iron content of 25% of dietary supplement for one tablespoon. In my opinion, that should be more than enough for most individuals who follow a normal healthy diet.I bought this product because I'll be turning 57 years young in a few weeks and my hair has turn grey on some areas. My concern is not about my grey hair, but rather at the cause. There are numerous reasons for hair to turn grey; sometimes prematurely. In my case, heredity may be the factor, as both of my parents have grey hair at an early age. But who is to say that their condition was not due to lack of certain nutrients or from an unbalance diet?I believe the only way for me to find out is to provide my body with healthy foods that can help the different organs function as healthy as possible. I have confidence in Blackstrap Molasses as a healthy product, which along with other health products and a decent diet can do the body much good.

I must say though, that my recent purchase of this O.N.E coconut water in the 11.2 oz aseptic containers tasted so bad that I had to force myself to drink it down.  The expiration is not until August, 2013, which is 2 months away.  Still, I had to mix one container of this with 2 11.2 OZ containers of sweetened coconut water just to get it palatable enough to get it down.  The Zico on the other hand, expires this month, but still tastes good.I will not order this particular O.N.E brand again, at least not close to expiration.",2,"Must have gotten a bad batch",1370908800,"2011-03-11"

The hint of pineapple adds a little bit of acidity that enhances the basic taste of the water. i bet this would make a great summer drink too, but I only had one so I didn't get tot try that.

"B000UUWECC","The reason I decided to purchase this brand in the first place is because it is one of the only brands of coconut water that isn't from concentrate and doesn't add any sugars. This is the closest thing to drinking from a coconut when you don't live in area conducive to growing them. As far as taste, it taste like actual coconut water. Most of the people leaving 1 star reviews have not ever tasted &#34;true&#34; coconut water and are comparing it to processed junk. The analogous situation would be leaving a bad review about a fresh squeezed orange juice(ie. not sold in grocery stores) and saying it tastes bad because it doesn't taste like Minute Maid.

"B000UUWECC","I've tried coconut juice from various companies, and this particular specimen ranks slightly higher than average in flavor.  Sweet, but not cloyingly so.  And, of course I shouldn't forget to offer props to these folks for ""keeping it real"" so to speak... letting the coconut juice stand on its own -- thankfully no additives, preservatives, etc.But still, despite the pleasant convenience of the package and the decent taste, it just didn't compare to the real thing:  a coconut with a straw stuck in it... either in flavor, or (likely) in health benefits.With that said, however, I think it'd be a fine (and enjoyable) idea to stock a bunch of coconut juice packs from this company for throwing into your gym bag, because this drink is hugely more healthy (and I believe, far more tasty) than any sports drink.

"B000UUWECC","During my childhood till my teen years ,we had a fertile coconut tree within my family's property.It bears fruit all throughout the year.We had a long bamboo stick with a knife in the end to cut the fruit down ,use a machete to cut it open and drink the water and the young meat.I have left that house long time ago now .It has been years and the only time I get to drink and eat a fresh coconut is when I go to Hawaii.Even at the Asian stores that sells the suppose to be young coconut is a gamble.I have tried  coconut drink in a can before that were sold in Asian stores and everytime I drank it I almost threw up ,so I avoided those drinks but when I saw this product in a grocery store and said to myself to  give it a  try and so I tried  this 100% coconut. I first tried Naked Cpconut water, I found it really refreshing but expensive.So I tried this O.N.E. brand and actually got lucky.This one actually tasted better that Naked.Its pretty acceptable for my standard but not as good as the one from a real young coconut.I tried another brand VitaCoco but this one has a strong aftertaste that is not natural,that I have tasted in the canned coconut drinks. I dont like it.UPDATE: Ju;y 2011.The new O.N.E. that just got delivered has a different packaging and this one does not taste fresh or young. It tastes old.I got 2 boxes of these.It now taste as bad as the ZICO.The past boxes of ONE were pretty good but the one that got delivered for this month is not good at all.",3,"Not Bad at All but",1300492800,"2011-03-11"

But it tastes fresh and was mildly enjoyable when poured over ice.  It's just not my thing at all, and as it's a wee bit expensive, it's unlikely I'll try it again.  But to its credit, I've got more coconut water-enthusiastic friends who swear by this and maintain it tastes just like its real, on-the-beach equivalent.  And it's loaded with potassium goodness.

I've been buying the canned version occasionally at the store and have been trying to decide which brand I like best.  So far I've tried the generic cheapo brand from the asian store, Amy & Brian's Coconut Water, Vita, and now ONE.  I think I like ONE the best.  It is definitely the lightest flavored of the bunch.  Some people have complained that it's TOO light and not coconutty enough.  I guess it's a matter of preference.  I also like the packaging best and think it's better than the canned variety.  The metal taste leeches into the water in the canned versions I think.  Anyhow, ONE's flavor is the closest to fresh tasting coconut water, mostly because of the packaging.

Its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others. Its more like a juice drink than a healthy one. Compared to Vitacoco it has more calories, twice the sodium, half the potassium and almost half the vitamin C. This drink also has less magnesium, phosphorous, and 4 times less calcium. The only this the drink does have over Vitacoco is the 1 less gram of sugar.

After a study in Purdue noted that rats gained more weight with artificial sweeteners than natural sugar (article cited below) I began to rethink the diet soda plan.  Coconut water is a great alternative to regular soda and juice... O.N.E. has only 60 calories compared to at least twice that with soda/juice -- plus, no artificial sweeteners.  It's definitely not as sweet but you get used to it... now, regular soda tastes too sweet to me.I have had numerous canned coconut water beverages purchased in Asian food stores.  They were all processed with added sweeteners and preservatives with a very obvious unnatural taste.  O.N.E., however tastes great!  Very close to the coconuts that I've had in India and the Caribbean islands.  I do like Coco Vita better (also available here on Amazon) as it has less of an aftertaste.

Surprisingly, both weren't that great although I think in one case it may have to do with them trying to mix other juices in (i.e. not pure coconut water).  Another brand I tried was worse.  That's pretty sad because other than good OJ or apple juice, nothing beats coconut water and more people ought to know about it.  No matter what brand you try, I wouldn't recommend non-pure coconut water like mango or other juices mixed in because it takes away from it.I've had coconut water straight from coconuts, and this is as good as I've had.  So it was a pleasant surprise when years back they started selling this stuff.  In many cultures, Coconuts are a daily staple and the source of a wide range of critical nutrients.

"B000UUWECC","Everyone should drink more water, or so we are told. The problem is that water is plain and boring. It needs some flavor, and many companies have responded to this demand. O.N.E. Coconut water with splash of pink guava is one such product. It contains coconut water along with guava juice for a unique taste.I like the taste of coconut but I am only so- so on the flavor of guava. Still, I decided this drink was worth a try because as long as it emphasized the coconut, it would be fine. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. O.N.E Coconut Water with a splash of guava is misleading in its naming, because you taste more guava than anything. Even then, the taste is rather unexciting. Even lovers of the flavor of guava will likely find this product a letdown.Nutritionally, O.N.E. Coconut water is very good, with low calories and a large dose of vitamin C and electrolytes in each serving, and more potassium than a banana. The sugar content is a little higher than some would prefer, but it isn't too bad and, unlike other sweet drinks, you get a good deal of nutritional trade- off for the sugar. Each time I take a sip and feel dissatisfied, I keep reminding myself of the nutritional benefits.Along with the bland flavor profile, there is one other problem I have with this drink, and that is the packaging. It is sold in a small foil box, which is ordinarily not a problem, but there is no included straw. There is an opening at the top that must be pushed- in to open, but the manufacturer doesn't include a straw. Thus, you have to use a fork or some other device to forge an opening. Then, you must carve out just the right shape for drinking from the box OR have another glass handy in which to pour the liquid.I wanted to like this beverage but when all factors are considered, I must rate O.N.E. Coconut Water with a splash of guava as a below average product. The coconut flavor is masked by the guava, the taste is unexciting, and the packaging is flawed. Yes, you get a good deal of nutrition so the product isn't a complete bomb, but there are other, better tasting products on the market with equally good nutrition, better taste, and more sensible packaging.",2,"Good Nutritional Value, but Essentially Flawed",1265241600,"2011-03-11"

"B000UUWECC","Coconut Water with a splash of PineappleThis is refreshing!  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  The coconut flavor isn't pronounced, and the pineapple isn't so overpowering that it tastes like syrup.  It's clean tasting.  According to the packaging, ""it has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.""  There's a smidge of fiber, 0.8 g of protein and 16 g of sugars.  I suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple, but ""cane juice"" is one of the ingredients, too. The 8.5 fl oz carton comes to 75 calories.If you sign up for subscribe & save, it's less than $1 per carton.  Actually, the carton is the only thing I don't like about this drink.  It's sort of hard to drink directly from because there isn't any air getting let in when you drink, which makes a vacuum.  This was solved by pouring it into a glass.  *whew*This was good.

"B000UUWECC","My family has been adopting a raw foods diet for the last year, and one of the things we have been able to enjoy is eating young green coconuts.A young green coconut looks like a woody white cylinder with a point on the top of it.  In order to open it, you take a heavy cleaver type knife and you strike it in four sides around the point of the coconut.You then take off the top and inside you get anywhere from 1/4 to a full cup of coconut water- a clear sweet nectar with subtle coconut flavor.Drinking this type of juice is a delightful experience, however, it does take some work to get at and is not always convenient- until now.When I first saw the 11 oz aseptic container of O.N.E coconut water, I was not sure what to expect.  I know that I expected it to be flat tasting and probably nothing like I was used to from having fresh green coconut water.I was wrong.This coconut water might not be fresh and raw, but it is the closest thing to it that I have come across so far.The foil wrapped box has about a 5/8"" opening (slanted square) that is covered with foil.  You peel that off and it forms a slight spout for easy pouring.It is best served cold, so I kept in the refrigerator.The water/juice inside is a slightly cloudy clear liquid which has the delightful taste of young green coconuts.  There is a refreshing coconut flavor that is not at all overwhelming, but just right.It has no added flavors or sugars to it, which is delightful.  It has only 60 calories which is also a nice feature.I have compared it to fresh coconut water, and although I do prefer raw fresh water, I am very happy with this as a substitute.I can say this, my family all fought to taste this stuff- so it made a big hit here.If you are into raw foods and need to have a beverage which is close to what you are used to and is not cooked to death and sweetened in a package to take on a picnic, trip, or even to work, this is definitely a great item to have handy.You might like it even if you are not into raw foods, but like the fragile coconut flavor in coconut water- you should give this a try.I do want to mention that this is NOT the kind of water that comes out of very dark brown dried coconuts- that tastes very different than young green coconuts.",5,"The Closest Thing to Fresh Young Coconut Juice But In A Box!",1211414400,"2011-03-11"

"B000UUWECC","Lifting, jumping, training -it's all part of my conditioning. As an athlete I need more potassium that the average bear. And for the past two years I've had restless leg syndrome. I'd fall asleep, and JUST as I'm about to cross that threshold into that nice, deep, relaxing REM sleep, I WAKE UP with this powerful, annoying urge to stretch my quads.Even eating two banana's a day, stretching, warm shower, and two water bottles right before falling asleep I still got these insanely insatiable cramps. Well, I take one O.N.E before falling asleep and I sleep through the night. Don't pay GNC prices for Potassium pills, because 90mg won't even phase you. I've tried three of those GNC Potassium pills and didn't even feel a difference.O.N.E tastes good (even delicious after you've drank it for a while), is refreshing with it's smooth, sublte taste, and actually cured my restless leg syndrome.

"B000UUWECC","This product is billed as an all natural anti-oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars.",2,"Bland",1264636800,"2011-03-11"
"B000UUWECC","My parents, who were stationed on Guam during the Korean war years, raved for years about the cocoanut water which came from fresh, green cocoanuts.  Apparently on Guam, in the fifties, it was a treat to bring in a bunch of green cocoanuts to their Quonset hut, extract the liquid and mix it with other fruit juices for an island treat.  They never actually said so, but I think some of those juices might have been of the fermented variety.  Anyway, when I saw this product on Amazon, I immediately ordered a case.  I must say that drinking straight cocoanut water is an acquired taste.  Two of my teenaged daughters liked it better than sports drinks, and thought the exotic nature of it gave it cachet among the athletes on their various teams.  They are anxious for me to order more.My dad said that this beverage is not quite like the fresh cocoanut water he recalls from his Navy days on Guam, but that it is very close.  He, too, wants to stock it in his pantry.  He said that the water he remembers was a little more flavorful.  But he did say that they seldom drank it straight, so he may have a faulty memory.As for me, I found the taste of this water a little on the thin side.  I expected more of a true cocoanut flavor.  I did try mixing it with fresh-squeezed orange, lemon and lime juices and adding a little sugar -- I found that helped enormously.  But I hardly think that's the point.This beverage is wonderful for those who have already developed a taste for cocoanut water, as my dad says it's very close to what can be found in Nature.  It is also a low-calorie, potassium-rich drink which might fit in very nicely with a sports or exercise regimen.  As for me, I might try a real green cocoanut and its liquid the next time I'm on a desert island.  But I think I will leave this beverage for those who are sophisticated enough to truly appreciate it.",5,"Very close to the real thing -- but definitely an acquired taste",1250899200,"2011-03-11"
"B000UUWECC","So, I kind of grew up on coconuts... having been born on a beach town.  I also grew up Coconut milk, so I was pretty excited about this product.  However, after drinking it... it doesn't meet any of my expectations. It doesn't taste like Coconut  and simply tastes really watered down.  In fact, it tastes like you're just drinking water... very plain.  It wasn't very sweet or flavorful. I may be a little harsh because Coconuts are near and dear to my heart, but I have to be honest and I think they could have done much better.  For those of you who love coconut milk, I would recommend buying young coconuts from your local Asian supermarket. You can open it up, drink fresh milk and even eat some fresh coconut meat.  Nothing beats that experience... the real deal. Plus, it's better for the environment... no plastic containers or trash to worry about.

"B000UUWECC","If you've ever had the good fortune of drinking coconut water from a coconut (preferably picked yourself, top hacked off by machete), you know how refreshing and sublime it is. There's also nothing else that tastes like it. Coconut water is a slightly opaque water that seems to have a little weight to it (it's not the milk, which comes at a later stage in the coconut's life). The taste of coconut is very faint, and it's super smooth going down. There are few things on earth more thirst-quenching on a hot day.Since, for most of us, young coconuts are not readily available, coconut aficionados are happy there's ONE Coconut Water. Water is usually my preference for a portable drink---filtered water from your tap in a stainless bottle. But there are times when water isn't going to quite do the job. Coconut water is packed with electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and phosphorous), so it makes for quick hydration. Keep some in the fridge and on hot days like today slip a couple in your backpack on the way out the door. Coconut water is also very useful to have on hand in the winter--it's great for when your child is sick and won't eat or drink.There is no sugar, it's miles away from any ""sport drink"" out there, and my son thinks it's a huge treat. The packaging is the eco friendly tetra-pak which supposedly doesn't leach any harmful chemicals (I'm always a bit skeptical these days) and ONE participates in a carbon reduction program. Be sure they are super cold--I like to have them refrigerated a good 24 hours before drinking.",5,"My Favorite Commercial Coconut Water",1249689600,"2011-03-11"

There's no denying that it's healthy, fat-free, gluten-free and all-natural... but unless you already know you like coconut water/milk, this might not be the thing for you. Having tried coconut milk before, I knew what to expect. It had a slightly foul smell, and the taste is different from anything else. Coconut water is an acquired taste.When my sister tried it, she spit it out in the sink. When my dad tried it, he said, ""it's just water."" (It's true--it's very faintly flavored). I didn't think it was the world's greatest drink, but my opinion wasn't quite so negative as that.While not delicious, I will say that the product IS healthy, and its taste is not overbearing.

It doesn't contain additives, sugar or anything else, just coconut water. Now, if you want something that tastes a bit fruitier there are other brands that add fruit juice to theirs and it does make it taste better but also adds carbs, which means the drink doesn't work as well to use during cardio, particularly if you are trying to lose weight.I also appreciate that they chose to sell their product in cartons instead of cans, especially in light of the new research about metals leaching in our food and drink.",4,"One of the best-tasting coconut water drinks on the market",1213660800,"2011-03-11"

"B000UUWECC","We come from a tropical country where coconuts are in abundance. We have grown up drinking fresh coconut water knowing fully well its health benefits over all those carbonated, artificially flavored drinks that contain a lot of bad than good.In the US, there is no way you are going to get fresh coconut water that is as tasty. So we shopped around quite a bit and tried out several different brands (from oriental stores, local farmer's market and Whole Foods) before settling down on O.N.E. Most brands (esp. those from the oriental stores) tasted down right awful and there were nothing like the natural coconut water. To make matters worse these had weird preservatives added in (which is a big NO NO). A handful few came close (that were found in Whole Foods), but taste wise O.N.E was definitely the best one.Ah..one more thing..always drink this chilled (tastes a lot better).Here are the reasons to like it...- It's very close to the FRESH coconut water- The tetra pack they use is BPA free and the packaging says its lightly pasteurized and there are no added chemicalsWhy its not rated 5 stars (YET)...- We hope they will step up and make everything organic (to completely eliminate unwanted pesticides and fertilizers).- Not much is known about how the coconuts are grown, where they are grown, how they are harvested etc.- Its not certified ""Fair Trade"", so we do not know how the farmers are being paid.

I was messed up, and I do not say that lightly.  I managed to get home, embarrassed and feeling godawful.  I remembered having read somewhere that coconut water is good for a hangover, so I had two O.N.E. coconut waters.  Within a couple of hours I felt perfectly fine.  I sure hadn't expected that!

If you're feeling a little dehydrated, this will help.I love the taste, too, although it took two or three times of drinking it before I could say that.  The first couple of bottles, I didn't care much for it.  Not that I actively disliked it; it just wasn't anything like what I would have expected, having only ever had sweetened coconut products previously.  And I liked how drinking it made me feel so... healthy.  Now I can't stand the thought of not having it around.

Like the difference between night and day. O.N.E. is a little more expensive than the other brand noted here, but it is worth it if you plan on drinking straight from the container. The taste is a little bit bitter, after all, it is the juice from an unripe coconut. But it is tolerable, tho it may take many awhile to get accustomed to. When I bought the Vitacoco brand, I learned to mix it with Gatorade to make it tolerable. If you are new to this product, you may want to do the same with O.N.E. at first, until you acquire a taste for it.I, in fact, changed my review from four stars to five stars, as I have tried a few other brands, and this one is still the best.

"B000UUWECC","O.N.E.'s Coconut Water is about straightforward as it gets: 100% coconut water.My first encounter with the green globe and the coconut water inside came after a climb of 1500 steps (and back down again) in ninety-plus degree heat on a dry, dusty winter day in Palitana India.  While I fell far short of the 3500 needed to reach the plateau of temples, I also barely managed to return to the base.Blame it on my Anglo-European genes, sheesh.Back at our vehicle, a vendor hacked off the top of the green globe before offering it too me.  Though the water within was warm, it was more refreshing and cooling than anything else I could have imagined at that moment.The inherent cooling properties of coconut water make it an ideal way to stave off the heat from both the inside out.O.N.E.'s coconut water, though not as 'mentally' satisfying to drink (everyone loves the green globe) certainly is as tasty and refreshing.",4,"From the Inside Out, Coconut Cools the Soul, um, the Body",1214352000,"2011-03-11"

I dont drink sodas for hydration, sports drinks are OK-but get boring, and water is great but not 100% of the time.  So recently I decided to give ONE coconut water a try and I thank God that I did.  It is totally refreshing, completely rehydrating, and the subtle coconut flavor is delicious.  Please believe, this is not coconut milk.  It is not thick or heavy.  It is light and refreshing.  I buy it at a local grocery only store and it is $2.50 per 11 oz box.  A little on the pricey side but well worth it.  Ive been drinking 2-4 per day and lovin it like Mcdonalds.  Its healthy, it tastes great, and does everything that it says and more.  I definitely give this drink my seal of approval.

"B000UUWECC","O.N.E. Coconut water is the liquid found inside young coconuts, not to be confused with coconut milk. Coconut water is found in the core of young, green coconuts. As the coconut matures this liquid largely becomes absorbed into the nut's flesh. Coconut water has long been a popular drink in the tropics, especially in Brazil, Tropical Asia and Trinidad and Tobago, where it is available fresh or bottled. It is naturally fat-free and low in food energy (16.7 calories or 70 kilojoules per 100 grams).Coconuts for drinking are carefully packaged and sold in many places.  In Central America, particularly in Costa Rica, it is found and sold in strategic highway stops or on the beaches; there, the coconut water is called ""agua de pipa"", and the coconut is cut in front of the customer to ensure its freshness. O.N.E. Coconut water is a natural sports drink because of its high potassium and mineral content which helps the body recover from rigorous exercise.I LOVE THIS O.N.E.

The flavor of VitaCoco seems much better to me. The ""use by"" dates of both shipments were fine, but O.N.E.'s taste just didn't do it for me; yet, I've tasted O.N.E. from other sources beforehand and liked it, so perhaps these coconut waters can differ from batch to batch?  If my next auto shipment of O.N.E. leaves me flat again, I will definitely cancel it and keep just the VitaCoco.

"B000UUWECC","Not being a medical or nutritional expert, I can't comment on the health benefits of coconut water. The product's claimed benefits seem reasonable and commendable.It seems that there's a real craze these days for juice-type beverages, and although the benefits of increased intake of fruits and vegetables are well-known, the price for these ""high-end"" beverages is typically $3.50 to $5.00 for a single serving, and often contains 300 calories or more. Comparatively speaking, O.N.E. Coconut Water is a low-calorie bargain.I've never had coconut water before, so I didn't know exactly what to expect. To my suprise, O.N.E. Coconut Water is quite clear, almost like water. An 11-oz serving contains only 60 calories, so as expected there is just a hint of sweetness. The coconut taste is also very light. There is no bitterness, no strange aftertaste. It's a truly refreshing beverage, and a pleasant surprise!",4,"Refreshing!",1213315200,"2011-03-11"
"B000UUWECC","Coconut water is the liquid inside an unopened coconut. It is not ""coconut milk,"" although there is often confusion about that. Coconut milk is made from the meat of the coconut after it is opened and the water poured out. Inside the coconut, the water is sterile and very benign to the human body - it has been safely used in emergencies as IV fluid! (Straight out of the coconut, that is, NOT from a Tetrapak.)Coconuts in general are very healthy items. In the South Pacific the coconut palm is called ""the tree of Life,"" because it provides so many things for a healthy life: food, water, shelter, medicine, etc. Coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils on the planet, but has been the victim of intense propaganda campaigns by corporate vegetable oil cartels and other evil critters.Coconut water tastes (to me) a bit like very watery, unsweetened tapioca, with just a hint of sourness. It is quite bland by itself, but mixes easily with fruit juices, etc. It has great health properties and is rapidly becoming popular with athletes as a superb isotonic drink, because it has great electrolyte and mineral properties, and is a natural food with no harmful side effects or hideous chemical garbage masquerading as food.Good organic coconut water is very hard to find, but there are many brands of non-organic like this one on the market. I checked out the package info and vendor's web site, but could find only general information on coconut water and its benefits, nothing specific about this exact product - where and how it is grown and harvested, the quality of the land and processing, etc. That is not a good sign.For an item that is very health oriented, the only reasons I can see for hiding that information are pure marketing ignorance, or knowing that the truth would not paint a good picture. Rain forests are reportedly being cut down for coconut palm plantations, especially those dedicated to unhealthy corporate factory farming practices. It would be vital for a company to distance themselves from that kind of activity by using only properly grown plants on healthy, environmentally sound plantations, and making that a very prominent part of their marketing.It would also be vital to play up everything possible that points to a healthy product by specifically mentioning those things about this specific product, not just general properties. This company doesn't do any of that, so I can only assume that this product is not produced in a way they want me to know about. That is the kiss of death for a product in my eyes. Granted, I am fussier than most in this regard.Don't be misled by the ""100% Natural"" marketing hype. That means virtually nothing. It is not a strict, legally defined standard, as is ""USDA Organic,"" for example. Virtually anything found in ""nature,"" i.e. toxic heavy metals, MSG (yes, it occurs in nature), animal manure, etc., can be considered ""natural"" and can legally be included in a product labeled ""100% Natural."" Granted, USDA organic standards are very weak as organic standards go (compared to say, Oregon Tilth), but they are still better than nothing.While I love coconut and want to give this product 4 or 5 stars, the complete lack of honest information about its origins and processing make me VERY, VERY suspicious.

The recall was on all shipments with a sell date of ""May XX, 2011"". Ugh. By April I have already consumed the entire March shipment.

I decided to take advantage of the Amazon subscription service to have 2 cases delivered each month. O.N.E. brand was the best tasting of all of the coconut waters out there - at least until 2 months ago. I am not sure if they changed coconut suppliers or if something changed with their processing but the for the last 2 months the product's taste has changed (and is not as tasty/flavorful as it used to be).

I have tried all the competitors and they simply do not stack up.Zico, while the most price efficient, is garbage as they sacrifice quality of their formula by mass producing it from concentrate in an attempt to cut costs.Vita Coco, while better than Zico, seems to focus more on mass marketing and endorsing their product than on producing the most natural and delicious formula.  Vita Coco is much like the Patron of coconut water.  Similar to Patron, Vita Coco is a solid product marketed and endorsed heavily to the masses, but true connoisseurs of the drink know that it is not the best.O.N.E. coconut water is the best.  The company's focus is on their product, improving their product, and making sure that their drink is the most natural, most organic product on the market; not on cost efficiency or creating a false image through mass marketing.",5,"O.N.E.

"B000UUWECC","...Then O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is the drink for you.  I found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage.  According to the package, O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE contains natural coconut water, natural pineapple juice, cane juice, vitamin C, and natural fruit flavor.  Personally, with the coconut and the pineapple, I think they could have left out the sugar cane.However, when I paired O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink.  I, apparently, needed a little salt and/or savory to make O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE completely palatable.  With the afore mentioned snack, the O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is really delightful.  I can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today (not so much with the cold winter weather).O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE comes in a handy 8.5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through.  This type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids.  Just throw it in your bag and go.Prior to this experience, I had not heard of coconut water.  On the packaging it says ""O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is a blend of the natural water from inside a young, green coconut and sweet, golden pineapple juice. It has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.""  Huh...who knew you could drink a green coconut?  Educational and a good source of potassium.  Being allergic to bananas, it is always good to have another source.Overall, I would not drink O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE by itself in the middle of winter.  But together with non-sugary snack or in the high heat of summer, I would definitely give O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE another try.",4,"If You REALLY Like Sweet...",1264550400,"2011-03-11"

I was relieved to see the O.N.E. coconut water with a ""splash of pineapple"" so I figured I'd give it a go.The woman at the counter said ""are you sure you want that? It's $4."" Steep! But it's an airport, what can you do? By that point I was so wanting to try it I said sure.  After all, it would've been $3 for a sticky sweet soda.I was so happy with it that I kept the empty tetra pack with me the whole time I traveled so I would know which one it was.  It doesn't taste heavy (in case the pina colada reference made it sound that way) but the pineapple takes the edge off the green coconut water.

The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.

It doesn't have a distinct coconut flavor either. Very little, and slight flavor of coconut, almost doesn't exist. Expect something like water, no color. Regular flavored waters you find in supermarkets have a more distinct flavor, but this one doesn't. They are sitting in my fridge and I don't wanna drink them, I have a very good appetite and I'm not a picky person, but I don't want to drink that thing at all.

It keeps your body cool and maintains it proper and normal temperature. It is considered to be natural isotonic beverage and re-hydrates your body orally. It is also one of the best health drinks as after vigorous exercise it replenishes your body fluids.It may also rejuvenates body cells by carrying oxygen and various essential nutrients, what can be beneficial in enhancing your body metabolism.Coconut water improves your immune system and it is also helpful in controlling and reducing excess weight gain. Hence effective in weight loss.It may efficiently cleanses your digestive tract and act as an effective natural detoxifying and anti-viral drink.Besides rejuvenating your body it also maintains and balances your body pH and it is observed that it also enhances proper blood circulation.All of this in just one tetra pak, and thanks to O.N.E., it tastes like the real coconut water!It is O.N.E. of a kind!!!",5,"The only O.N.E.!!!",1216771200,"2011-03-11"

"B000UUWECC","I'm somewhat perplexed as to why reviewers slammed this for not having enough flavor because the name says it all. This is supposed be a light, subtly flavored beverage. I think it's delicious.I'm also left scratching my head as to assertions that this product contains sugar; it contains CANE JUICE which is not only far more dilute than sugar but is enjoyed on its own as a delicious, healthful beverage and is well worth sampling if you can find it (it's fairly easy to find fresh in NYC's Chinatown). For the record, it's not sickeningly sweet and is claimed to have anti-cariogenic properties (I love the stuff). Don't downgrade a product because you don't know how to interpret what's printed on a label (let the negs begin).O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava is very refreshing when you're in need of an electrolyte boost and I agree with other reviewers that 8.5 ounces is insufficient for a fierce thirst; I hope O.N.E. has this flavor slated for 1-liter packaging. The flavor is exquisite, as is the color. This also makes a great base for a pink guava smoothie--blend with a frozen banana, coconut milk (canned is fine), frozen pink guava pulp, and a sweetener of your choice (coconut sugar would be great). Delicious AND pretty! You could also, if you prefer a different liquid (such as yogurt or fruit juice), freeze it in an ice cube tray and add to the other ingredients to thicken and chill your smoothie--it's the kind of product you can get creative with if you're into playing in the kitchen.To sum it up, O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava does NOT contain added sugar, doesn't claim to be a juice, and is well worth trying, especially if you can find it on sale. In addition, although I'm a Vine Voice, this product wasn't offered to me for review; I'm of my own initiative evaluating my own purchase.

However, in light of all the comments regarding Jon's post, I thought I'd share some things I read on the Internet re coconut water & coconuts. I suspect there might be some people who are interested. Pasteurization kills a lot of the beneficial ingredients in coconut water, but it's an FDA requirement that All coconut water be pasteurized (possibly the brand that's sold in a crystalized form doesn't need to be pasteurized (I don't know).  I read on several sites that coconuts shipped to this country are preserved in formaldehyde, so maybe it's actually better to drink the coconut water that's packaged from coconuts in their native country, than to drink it from the coconut itself which has been shipped here. Of course drinking it from the coconut itself when you're lucky enough to be in a tropical country would be best.

The flavor is sickly sweet (ingredients included added sugar), and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters I've tried. Might as well be a processed kids drink.Alternatives: While I actually prefer O.N.E.'s regular, unflavored coconut water over other brands, the Vita Coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one.

You know the texture of the banana, especially those little slivers that come off the skin, is a little powdery after you've eaten for a while?  Take that texture, remove the banana flavor, mix it in water, and you've got this.  Or extremely watered down milk.  I just can't see this really refreshing anyone, because there's no ""kick"" to it.So what's good about it?  Well, it's natural.  I give it kudos for that, because there are a lot of non-natural beverages out in the world making us sick.""That's it????""  I mean, what more can I really say about it?  The taste is horrendous, I wasn't refreshed after drinking it, I can't imagine buying this in the store, etc etc.  Sorry I can't put more words to this review, but the above summarizes my reaction as best I can.",3,"I don't know how to describe this...",1212192000,"2011-03-11"
"B000UUWECC","great product, kind of expensive, especially when not on sale for 10$ or under for a twelvepack, which it does drop to on amazon quite often with Subscribe and Save.  I read lots of reviews of O.N.E. and VitaCoco, the two major brands I focused on because they seemed to have the most sales/least negative reviews out of the three best selling brands.  Frankly, Vita and ONE are really fairly close in taste, with O.N.E. tasting more natural, less of an aftertaste, and I think that's probably because Vita jams 240% of Vitamin C into each tetrapack.  That does alter the taste, making it slightly more acidic and to my tongue at least, not as fresh/tasty as O.N.E.  I haven't tried Zico yet, and based on some all over the place reviews, I'm probably not going to.  VitaCoco seems to have the same comments here and at a lot of other websites too, as in same wording, so I sort of doubt the veracity of half of Vita's reviews tbh, but regardless it's a great product too and I'd have no problem buying it again for the right price if this wasn't available or was at full price.  This was the first time I'd tried coconut water, and I was really surprised to find I liked it.  I was half expecting it to taste coconut-like, which it does not, which is good for me.  Closest thing I could think of to describe it would be if you can imagine drinking flavorless Gatorade, that's close.  Very refreshing/revitalizing, some slight natural sugar in it of course (none added), and really kinda tasteless.  The metallic taste people talk of I wonder if that might be because its just got so many electrolytes in it it sorta gives that tingle, not sure.  I did sorta notice it too, but it's hardly noticeable and not offensive.There was a product recall on this.  Amazon sent me an email saying it may have been mold contaminated and had been recalled.  I'd already guzzled the 12 pack a month before, and had drank down a case of Vita Coco too, so wasn't much for me to do.  I did find the box and checked UPC/exp date and it was not in fact affected by the recall, so in my single recall experience, Amazon erred on the side of caution, sending notices to people who weren't affected, as well as those who were, presumably.  That's good.  That's pretty encouraging.  If you check the recall notice it says that it was several reports of moldy product/damaged packaging that occurred in one region of the US and that a report of the factory found nothing, so probably occurred in shipping/distribution, not when packaged, but whatever.Amazon, drop this crap down to $8.97 a twelve pack or slt so I can stock up.  I am glad for the free shipping.  Without that, buying online for this wouldn't be practical.",5,"Delicious and Refreshing.

I received a sample and it sat in the fridge for a good week before I was brave enough to give it a taste.At first sip, it was much sweeter than I expected it to be. I could certainly taste the pineapple, but the coconut flavor was much more pronounced than I thought it would be. It was good! I very much enjoyed the taste of the drink. It was exotic and refreshing. It was much fuller in weight, as I was thinking it would be watery with a mild flavor.The box reminded me of those chocolate milks that I buy for my kids, but it didn't detract from the flavor.",5,"Sweet but not too sweet!",1268265600,"2011-03-11"

Now as to the ""Splash of Pineapple"", well it must not have been a very big splash, because I never did taste any pineapple. So what did I taste? It is hard to describe. It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any ""Natural Fruit flavor"".To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how ""healthy"" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.And as a ""thirst quencher"", it doesn't equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade.

"B000UUWECC","If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would!  Our family has tried VitaCoco and Zico Coconut Water (both were good) but O.N.E. Coconut water is our favorite because it includes little extendable straws that can be used like a juice box.  The handy straw allows you to neatly poke a hole through the foil seal for a no-spill drink...perfect for car rides or letting kids carry their drink around the house.  We also drink coconut water when we are ill, instead of Pedialyte or Gatorade (much more healthy).  The straw is a great way to get fussy toddlers to drink the fluids they need when they're sick.I highly recommend coconut water.  The consistency can take some getting used to because it's thicker than water or juice, but the nutritional value can't be beat.  It is the perfect drink for kids and athletes: an all natural, whole food....slightly sweet with fewer natural sugars than most fruit juices, no artificial colors or flavors, won't stain, packed with potassium and electrolytes, and it actually contains calcium and a little protein!  Packaged in small, recyclable Tetra Pak containers (eco-friendly) that contain no PBA like some plastics.  You can easily take this coconut water with you anywhere- I always keep a couple in the car and often stick one in my purse (although coconut water tastes best cold).  If you have any reservations about trying this product, just go for it!  If you really don't like it, you can always sell the rest on craigslist :)",5,"Includes Handy Straws!

"B000UUWECC","I recently switched to this coconut water after using Naked coconut water for several months.  Naked started to source from a different country and the taste was greatly affected in my opinion.  I was disappointed as I went to Naked from Vita Coco after receiving two very rancid batches.  I decided to try O.N.E. and I'm so glad I did.  I love it and find it to have the most nutty flavor of the three.  So far the quality has also been very consistent.  I didn't think I'd care either way about the attached straw but although I don't always use them, I do find the straw convenient on the go.  I am sticking to O.N.E. as long as the product stays consistent.  I drink the natural and find it incredibly refreshing.  I like it best cold in a glass.

The color was okay, the consistency was okay, not much of a smell.Then I tasted it, and the first thing that came to mind was, it's salty.  I had my wife try it as well, and she had the same feeling.  I looked at the product info, and it states that it has 5% of the USRDA for sodium, which is too much for a drink, in my opinion, especially a ""Coconut Water"".  Something like Gatorade, which is for electrolyte replenishment, I can forgive, but not for this.I then thought more about the taste, besides the saltiness, and what I really had to conclude was that the the mix of flavors didn't do anything for me.  No real sweetness from the coconut, no sourness from the guava.Overall, Not crazy about it.Now, I do have something positive to say about the container, it held up well, and it's relatively easy to open, although I'd add a ring to the aluminum foil-like pull tab.

There is a difference between young coconuts and more aged coconuts. The older ones are much sweeter :) but the young ones are more refreshing and much healthier.So if you dont know what you talking about..its not right to leave a negative review, because to really know the difference between coconuts you actually would have to taste the orginal product cut fresh and drink it out the nut.One...

I try to watch what I eat and drink and have found sports drinks to loose their appeal after awhile. I think they have too much sugar in them and often leave me with heartburn. These coconut waters are much better that any sports drink! They have minerals and electrolytes that your body needs with natural sugars. When I drink a chilled coconut water I feel much better and more energized. I can keep working hard after feeling refreshed. They give me more energy than any sports drink ever could and they do not give me heartburn. They are a little pricey but with the subscribe and save program they are 15% off.

I would happily purchase this product again and again.A word of advice to people complaining that it doesn't taste ""coconutty"" enough.  Coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things.  Coconut water comes from a green, immature coconut, while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut...a hard, brown, fiber covered shell.

"B000UUWECC","After hearing all the hype about coconut water, I was eager to try it out for myself.  I bought 2 different brands that I found at Whole Foods (one of those being this brand) to try out before I committed to a 12-pack purchase.  The other one I tried was okay but I absolutely loved the O.N.E. coconut water.  It tasted really fresh and I found that one was not enough.  I started craving it and immediately ordered the 12-pack from amazon and am now getting it delivered on a regular basis.  I am also ordering getting a subscription to this for my parents who really enjoy coconut water as well.If you haven't tried this, then I suggest getting an individual pack from the store to try it out first.  If you enjoy it, order it from here because with the subscribe and save discount.  This really is the best price I've found so far.I drink one of these daily after my workout and prefer it to Gatorade.  From what I've read, Gatorade is better for people who do heavy workouts since it contains more sodium but I prefer the taste of coconut water which actually has more electrolytes.Update 2/22/11I just tried Zico coconut water and it is nowhere as delicious as O.N.E. coconut water.

"B000UUWECC","I'd recommend this product for someone who needs potassium but can't or won't eat bananas. Potassium is important for your heart and if you are nauseous. It would be very effective for athletes or people in danger of dehydration. It's a natural, raw food containing 5 electrolyes, which are important for your heart to function properly. Your electrolyte balance can be upset by dehydration, over-exertion or illness, and any athlete can tell you that that's dangerous. This would be a great drink to have on hand if you could only have fluids or couldn't keep solid food down. I think of it more as a supplement than a beverage because there isn't much taste to it, but it would be handy to keep in your locker at the gym or in your bag. It's much healthier than a sport drink containing artificial colors and flavors.You'd expect it to taste like coconuts, but it really doesn't. There might be a faint suggestion of coconut flavor, but I'm not sure you'd notice it if you didn't know what you were drinking. Otherwise, it's like drinking water. Not bad, not really good, just there. I can see myself picking up one of these to eat with a meal just for the potassium boost, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I had the flu, was playing sports, working out or was working hard - like mowing lawns, gardening, doing construction - in hot weather . Then I'd want to have these in the fridge (they taste best ice cold,) because they would definitely be better than just drinking water.  I'd use it as a sort of adult Pedialyte or a natural Gatorade.

"B000UUWECC","O.N.E. has been my favorite coconut water besides the real thing. I've read reviews about the water tasting different depending on where the coconuts came from. I now see what they mean. I love the O.N.E. coconut water that comes from the Philippines! Unfortunately, this last case I oredered was product of Indonisia. There is definitely a difference. The water from Indonisia tastes &#34;off&#34;, like it's a little &#34;funky&#34; or a little edge of sour (I don't really know how to explain it). It's not as sweet and delicious as the product from the Philippines. Since there's no way to know which one you'll get from here, I'm sad to say I will no longer order this brand from Amazon. The only store I've been able to find O.N.E. is Walmart (and I hate going to Walmart!!) But I was able to find the product of Philippines there.This makes me very sad. I hope that the makers of O.N.E. see that this is a problem and go back to using product from the Philippines instead of Indonisia.

I grew up drinking coconut water from fresh young coconuts since I did grow up in central america right next to beautiful tropical beaches where you can sip on the best coconut water. Therefore I know what coconut water is supposed to taste like and I am one to have tried many of the coconut water brands that have been coming out throughout the years that claim to have the very natural taste of coconut water and from all those products this is the ONE to beat them all. Nor Vita Coco, Zico, Naked, Or Coco Libre come anywhere close to this product. ONE coconut water is so refreshing and natural tasting, the taste is as close as any one of these brands or products can  come close to delivering coconut water that might even compare one bit to the actual taste of coconut water being sipped out of a fresh tropical young coconut.

I also had my husband order a case as one of the family gifts for my sisters and parents. We already opened our case, and it was the most vile drink I have ever tasted. It seemed spoiled, and I really couldn't even tell that it was supposed to taste like coconut water. When my son got home from school, he wanted to try one. I told him they weren't good, but he insisted. He took a drink and said it was okay, but I could tell that he didn't want to admit it wasn't good. He took a few more sips, and then said he didn't want it anymore. I'm so glad that I tasted one first because I had planned on putting them in his lunch bag.

"B000UUWECC","IMO- O.N.E. is the best tasting coconut water available outside of sticking a straw into a coconut. But the 2 boxes of 11.2 Oz O.N.E. (no additional flavors in them) I bought on Amazon taste awful. The expiration date is in 2012.I believe the answer lies in temperature. The product I purchased from Amazon was shipped in the summer months and stored in perhaps a hot warehouse, definitely hot trucks, warhorses, etc.. on its way to me - August 2011 - a hot time of the year. I've had the same experience with all the other brands except Zico. This brand always has an awful aftertaste because it is made from concentrate - a process of heating.I discovered this product last fall when the tens were cooler. Now I have 2 cases of useless coconut water. And I have a kidney disease in which I need a lot of potassium - coconut water helps me fight this - naturally.So, be careful where and when in the year you buy coconut water*.  Some retail stores do better, but not all the time. I had to return a lot of another brand of coconut water to a national organic and natural foods supermarket.Same issue - same time of year - a serious aftertaste. If tastes fine to you, never mind.

"B000UUWECC","I have seen delivery truck for this drink driving around town.  On the side they had ""Natures Sport's Drink"".  I never thought of Coconut Water as a sports drink but I thought I would give it a try.The package the drink comes in is ""Tetra Pak""; which is a fancy way of saying juice box.  Because this seems very similar to the way I used to drink my Hi-C Juice when I was in grade school.  No straw here though, just a foil covered hole in which you peel off the foil to drink.Ingredients are as follows: Natural coconut water, pink guava puree, cane juice, vitamin c, and natural fruit flavor.  Not too bad, sounds good, you have to add vitamin c to give the drink a little zing otherwise it comes off too bland, and they at least admit to adding ""natural fruit flavor"" which if you read the FDA website doesn't really have to be that natural at all.  But all-in-all the ingredients list looks good.  One container is 8.5 ounces, one serving, and you have 78 calories, no fat, 128mg of sodium, 302mg potassium, 18.8g of carbs, with .5g of that being fiber and 16.6g being sugar.  You also get 0.8g of protein and the added vitamin c gives 183% of your daily value.  Let's move on to taste:Serve cold, shake well, and open...tastes like coconut and guava.  I guess I should have expected that.  It feels fairly light on the tongue, not that oily mouth coating feel you get from regular coconut water.  O.N.E. claims they get the water form green coconuts before the meat forms, so that accounts for the lack of oils and fats.  So you get nice tropical flavor.  Like a really watered down pina colada.  Sadly I am unable to perform blood work and tell you if my electrolytes are being replenished but I am enjoying the flavor.  So if coconut and guava appeal to you, and you would like those flavors in a natural sports drink, this may be the drink for you.",4,"They call it nature's sports drink",1266019200,"2011-03-11"

"B000UUWECC","Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.Bottom line?

I like the variety with the splash of Pineapple, Passion Fruit or Guava too and their calorie content is not that high either and I don't put splenda in them as they are naturally sweetened.  I will NOT buy VITA Brand Coconut Water because I found it it has Celebrity Investors and that right there just taints it.  (Madonna and a few others have a stake in Vita) I wrote to ONE on their website and asked about coupons and they arrived in my mailbox about 7 days later!

First off, I received a case that suspiciously did not have a USDA organic symbol that somehow is on the product image on amazon. Secondly, the product was way sweeter than Naked, which leads me to believe that they somehow add sugar to the product, because there can't be such a variation from one coconut water to another, if both claim to be all natural, blah, blah, blah. To be specific, O.N.E. has 3 more grams of sugar than Naked per 11.2 ounce serving. Because of the sugary taste, it makes the water less crisp and refreshing (and healthy) than Naked.

"B000UUWECC","This is the latest foray into the ""all natural"" nutritional drinks market. Despite boasting ""real fruit juice"" on the packaging, the flavor is simply too watered down to notice. Having drank plenty of coconut water, this drink has barely more than a hint of it. Most likely, it clashes with the taste of the guava, which is also hardly noticeable. In fact, were it not for the label on the packaging, this reviewer would not have been able to tell what the flavor was meant to be. Speaking of the which, the odd packaging is rather reminiscent of the fruit juice packs aimed at kids, sans the accompanying straw. Also, this 8.5 ounce drink will not go far to quench anyone's thirst or give any noticeable energy boost. Given the price for a pack of 12, it is not asking for much to give the consumer more juice for the buck. The nutritional content stacks up nicely to other comparable drinks, however it does have more sugar than some others currently on the market. Overall, O.N.E. has produced a product that is nothing special in the world of sports drinks. While it does offer fairly solid nutritional content, the bland taste and small size does not make this a good value.",2,"Watered Down Sports Drink",1272412800,"2011-03-11"

Coconut Water 11.2 oz - before, and never had a problem with it.  The first time buying this was at a store called, ""Always 99.""  At the ""Always 99,"" I purchased 198 of the 11.2 oz containers of this product at a price of 3 for 99 cents.  What a deal!!! Worth trying out at that price.  Before that time, I never tried coconut water before because too expensive for me.  Although the products I purchased at ""Always 99"" were 6 months past expired, the taste was always very good with no variation in taste.The O.N.E. 100% Coconut Water I purchased through Amazon.com was just as good - very pleasing.  Of course no one anywhere on the internet sells this product at 3 for 99 cents - even at past expiration dates.  And the ""Always 99"" store received thousands of containers of this product as a one time thing; so, I will likely never see that super deal again.I guess each of us has to decide for ourselves whether this, or any, coconut water is worth buying at present prices.  But O.N.E 100% Coconut Water 11.2 oz is a reliable high quality product in my experienced opinion. I mean, if this product is still just as good even 6 months after expiration date, then it has to be good bought before expiration.I add a sprinkle of Stevia Extract to each cup of coconut water for sweetness.",5,"O.N.E.

I do like the taste of guava, so I thought this would be a good way to sample some coconut water. I let it chill fully. Okay, actually I put it in the freezer and forgot about it. Thank goodness the aseptic pack did not burst. Once it was liquid again I gave it a taste and I was very pleased. The ""splash"" of guava was not overwhelming to me, as pure nectar can tend to be. It complemented (masked?) the flavor of the coconut water and was quite refreshing. Pure coconut water is not sweetened, as this one is, so that is a consideration for some. I think I am ready to try some of the pure coconut water now. There are other flavors of this type, too.

I checked the shipping carton and found that ONE has started getting its coconut water from the Phillipines.  Big mistake.  It's awful. The only way you'd know this is if you buy it by the case.  ONE doesn't identify the source country on individual Tetra Paks. Anyone who started with ONE in the beginning knows they used only Brazilian coconuts as their source.  The original stuff was crisp, clean and totally refreshing.  This new source is murky and not satisfying at all.  Time to look into other brands.

It also satisfies my sweet cravings without being sugary or doing crazy things to my blood sugar.  I'm sure kids will love it as well.  A much better option than a Sunny whatever juice box.  It is perfect for a packed lunch.  FIVE STARS! I'd give it more if I could.  The Mango flavor of this brand is also wonderful and the unflavored is a favorite as well.

For some reason, I decided to give this a try. I bought the mango flavor to help me with drinking the coconut water and I was surprised. It didn't have the strong coconut flavor that I have tasted in other foods or beverages. I barely even tasted the coconut. If I didn't know this was coconut water with mango, I would have thought it was some other drink,and this is all natural. I've been hearing alot of good things about coconut water.

Nothing will be beat drinking it right out of fresh coconut but O.N.E comes the closes.The coconut water is supposed to taste like fresh refreshing, slight sweet water with just a hint of coconut flavor. If you taste strong flavor of coconut, it is probably over ripe or aged.

It is absolutely refreshing without the excessive sweetness of some brands like Amy and Brian or Taste Nirvana. There's also no sour aftertaste like w/ vitacoco (which adds ascorbic acid as a preservative). It's a bit odd that A&B and TN source their coconuts from Thailand and ONE from Brazil.

I had to say &#34;bye bye&#34; to the chemicals and sugar, and go on a search for a healthy alternative.I've used quite a few products by Frontier, and they are almost always either nice or excellent, and ALWAYS full of healthy ingredients.

The only difference I can see between mine and the picture on here is the top. Mine is white with 3 ways to open -- sift, spoon or pour -- and all are very difficult to open. This can is very old, decades, and I was trying to figure out why it is still here. I suppose it's nostalgia because I certainly wasn't using it. Occasionally over the years I have tried to find this product and couldn't. I decided to Google it and arrived here. After reading the reviews, I realize why it wasn't being used. It is a very dark red and has a bitter, not sweet, taste. I have purchased other brands and been disappointed. None of them met the standards of the one my mother used which is why I kept trying to find this brand, hoping I just got a bad batch. I am going to purchase a can and see what I end up with this time.BTW, no bugs and if there were, they certainly would have had decades to do their thing.",2,"PUZZLED!",1403654400,"2015-01-29"
"B0012690UC","I read through all the reviews of course after I purchased this because I have used Hungarian Paprika all my life.  I never even questioned that some had issues so I wanted to share my experience. I just opened the Paprika to take a good look at it. I boiled a bit in water and am watching it now but I do not see any evidence of weevils as some have stated. What I do is after opening I put it in a storage bag and place it in the fridge for future use. My product is clean, fresh smelling and can't wait to use it.  I'm ready for some Hungarian Chicken Paprika.  When I purchased this I also purchased my dumpling maker at the same time. I have in the past when allowed to brought a variety of paprika back home and all the products lasted a good long time. I think those that did experience the problems noted must have 1st received an old product and perhaps it wasn't used very quickly either.  Don't give up because this can happen with a variety of products.  I always seal anything known for bugs like flour in it's bag but place it inside of a large heavy plastic bag that closes also.  I hope this helps and also the shipping was very quick.Additional info: In addition to all the reviews and tips given, check the expiration date, if the product is expired contact the company selling the Hungarian Paprika and of course that is unacceptable. Another thing I wanted to add is growing up eating Hungarian food all my life, (rarely did we ever go out to eat when I was growing up) I have found that I add more of the Hungarian Paprika then most do. I actually make mine a bit different and use chicken breasts which is what I like, many use boneless skinless thighs (more flavor). I actually cut up the chicken breasts and then pour some Hungarian Paprika over the chicken and stir. I want a ting of color on my meat and then after I cook my onions I do add a couple teaspoons more and also more Onion after I add the chicken. The flavor is so good. I don't know maybe I just like the flavor so much that I really think adding a bit more especially using chicken breasts makes the world of difference.

"B0012690UC","I am fortunate in that this is readily available locally. Much of my cooking does not require paprika, but I keep three different kinds in my spice rack because each is an indispensable flavor for some dishes.This one is the sweetest grade of the eight Hungarian grades and is called K&uuml;l&ouml;nleges. I use it as a garnish mostly; typically over deviled or hard boiled eggs and occasionally over other types of egg dishes. At the other end of the Hungarian paprika spectrum is another of the three types I use. It's from the same brand and is called Er&#337;s in Hungarian (seeTraditional Hungarian Paprika - Hotfor a description.) It's much spicier. The final type of paprika I use is a Spanish grade called piment&oacute;n de la vera. This one is smoky and hot, and vastly different than the Hungarian grades. My favorite brand isLa Chinata Hot Smoked Paprika by La Tienda.About the weevils. There are two products in which you can expect the pesky things: rice and paprika. I suppose some of the Americanized brands of paprika are weevil free, but they also lack the deep flavors of Hungarian (or Spanish) brands, and most fall far short of this particular brand. As one other reviewer recommended: keep it in the refrigerator and the problem will go away. The alternative is to use a bland variety and forgo the wonderful flavor this one imparts.

"B0012690UC","I purchased this item only once before moving on to bulk buying another brand. Compared to buying bulk, for sure, this 5 ounce can comes more expensive, however it is still good purchase when compared with similar sized alternatives. It came in a retro-style red metal box with a plastic top. Unlike some other reviewers, we have experienced no bugs or webs or any other nasty stuff in it. It was fine ground and of decent quality.The top has two openings: for faster and slower flow rate. I found them difficult to operate since they both had pretty stiff lids and for many occasions, opening those lids was a torture so I ended up removing the top all together and taking it by a spoon. I think It should have been designed better.About the taste: As I commented in the headline, it tastes sweeter compared to other paprika brands I used, it is okay but I can not say it has a prominent flavor so I am neutral about the taste, you may find that you need to put more paprika than the recipe asks for to get the same effect.It is a nice purchase,especially when bought through the subscribe and save program (offering up to 20% from the list price) however as I said, I can not say it is outstanding and if you are a massive paprika user, like myself, this size may not be appropriate for your needs.",4,"fine ground and a little on the sweet side.",1402272000,"2015-01-29"

"B0019LWITA","first, this brown rice flour is absolutely the best!  can be used to substitute for wheat flour in recipes. this brand is always fresh, tastes great & no off flavors.  however, i agree with the other review, regarding how amazon is selling this: without being a ""prime shipping"" item, the customer shipping cost would be so astronomical for 25 lbs, that i would never order it. i also will continue buying it from whole foods market.  i would order it from amazon if: the price were competitive with whole foods & there was ""prime shipping"".  customer beware of the cost & shipping charge as currently advertised.  only buy this: if you have allergies to other grains, do not live near a whole foods, and are willing to pay  huge shipping.  also, you may want to consider purchasing directly from  lundberg.",5,"lundberg brown rice flour",1335571200,"2014-11-14"

I love the Lundberg rice products because I don't have to worry about cross contamination of any other grains in their products, unlike other brands I have purchased.  The 25 lb sack of brown rice flour is a great size for our family and it fits nicely into one of my Vittles Vault containers and it lasts for about a month before I have to repurchase.  I also appreciate that the 25 lb brown rice flour arrives within a few days when I order and it is packaged well to keep it from being punctured in transit (with food allergies, we really don't want the sack to be damaged on route).

"B0019LWITA","Brown Rice Flour is a staple in my household due to the digestive needs of my household, so I needed to find a way to purchase it in bulk without buying out Whole Foods every month when I went so I checked on Amazon since I had Prime. It was really awkward at first and we considered not purchasing the item because instead of a bag of Brown Rice Flour or the like, there's a bottle of Calcium/Magnesium plus minerals liquid vitamin. And not even by the same company that the rice flour is claimed to be from. But we've always had a good experience buying from Amazon, LLC. So we risked it, knowing we could get our money back if something was wrong.Yet, once we got it and liked the product I went to bookmark it's location on Amazon and came across the fact that it was now TWICE as expensive as it had been, and we're not talking a $2 item going up to $4 but a $34 going up to $69. That's a helluva large chunk. I get Rice flour at retail for about $1.99 from Whole Food's. At $34, this was just slightly cheaper but now it's even more expensive to buy as a bulk than I'd have to pay at Whole Foods? I won't be purchasing again. Not only that, but now despite the fact that I bought it from Amazon, LLC in my orders list, the link sent me back to it now being sold by Nutricity. It may be more of an annoyance to buy from Whole Foods, but at least I know the price won't change on me the moment I purchase another bag.Five Points/Five Stars1. Item Quality - Good2. Company Behavior - Bad3. Timeliness - On Time (Amazon Prime)4. Price - Was good, changed the moment I bought it = Bad5. Experience - BadTo make a note, I know it's expensive to ship something which is the reason I suspect the price was changed when they realized that with Prime they had to cover a helluva shipping price but they should have figured that out before putting an item up for sale. I would have been buying a 25# bag every month or so at that price and now they've lost me as a customer completely because of their bad practices.",2,"Good Product but Suspicious Behavior",1332633600,"2014-11-14"

In fact, these nugo dark bars are so downright delicious that I'd likely pick them over most any packaged dessert choice.And indeed, these fall squarely into the dessert category, not health-food category.

My daughter and I decided we would do a taste test of each one so that we could buy the ones we liked in bulk off Amazon. It was a rather expensive endeavour, especially since we threw out over half of them after the first bite.Well, as you might imagine, there were quite a few BLECH! bars - virtually inedible. There were maybe a handful of bars that we deemed 'edible if really hungry and there were no other healthy options', and then there were about 3 that were really really tasty.NuGo Dark Chocolate Chocolate chip was pretty good.  Good chocolate flavor, texture crispy, not pasty.  190 calories seems high, but you do get 10g of protein with it.  I wouldn't call it delish, but how many protein/nutrition bars are really all that good?

"B001DGYKG0","A friend raved about these, so I had to try them.  The best I can say is that they're not bad.  At first, the dark chocolate seemed a delicious change of pace from most ""nutrition"" bars, but I found they had a terrible aftertaste.  At 200 calories and almost $1.50 each, I won't buy these again.  (In  fact, I'm going to give them to my friend.)",2,"Not worth the calories",1354838400,"2013-03-28"
"B001DGYKG0","Like another reviewer I happened upon these at an airport keosk when I needed a quick breakfast.  I was addicted from the first bar I had.  They are sweet and chocolatey with a little bit of crunch but luckily they have 10g of protein too.  They don't have a weird texture or protein aftertaste like some protein bars. They're great for a quick breakfast or snack on the go!  These are a must in my cabinet!",5,"LOVE These Bars!!!",1359504000,"2013-03-28"
"B001DGYKG0","These bars are Fantastic!  There is no weird protein-ey taste, just plain Good!  And the fact that they are Organic is a bonus, as well.  They are a good sized bar, not like those tiny 4 bite ones, and low glycemic at a good per bar cost.  If you like chocolate mint flavor, NuGo makes these bars in that flavor and it's Awesome!!",5,"YUUUMMMM!",1403481600,"2013-03-28"
"B001DGYKG0","This is a great breakfast/on-the-go bar and really just tastes like normal milk chocolate with a hint of dark chocolate.  Not very overwhelming with a slight crunch to it.  For some people, it might still be kind of bland when compared to other bars out there with caramel and everything but the kitchen sink in them, but this has 10g of protein and close to 200 calories with a huge amount of chocolate.  My picky eaters who try to skip breakfast or any meal often gladly grab one of these and never really seem to get tired of them.

"B001DGYKG0","It tastes better than a balance bar, and its vegan.  It tastes more like normal chocolate than dark chocolate, I think.  It has enough sugar to almost put it in the candy bar category, but the protein is high enough to make it not too bad for you.  It works in a pinch when I need a small energy boost and cant eat a meal or healthy snack.If they could put some vegan sources of the common difficult vegan vitamins (B12, D, Iron, Zinc and Calcium) in this, I would consider it as a daily snack.  Until then, I consider it a nice indulgence.",4,"Pretty good",1275782400,"2013-03-28"

"B001DGYKG0","I happened to buy a bar of these at the Tucson, AZ airport and couldn't find these in a store near me when I got back home. I liked them a lot. The chocolate isn't super sweet, which is the main reason I like it because I don't want to use a ton of sugar. Someone wrote it was a lot in calorie, but I disagree because the bar is large. It isn't like the normal granola bars you purchase at the store, it is much wider and thicker. So, I suppose more calorie, but it is due to it's size.I like it a lot.",5,"Yummy!",1357689600,"2013-03-28"

It is also the only peanut butter my 10 year old daughter will eat (can't get any other brands past her).  The reduced fat aspect of it may not save calories but it gives the product a slightly sweet taste, and for some reason only the Skippy brand maintains its smooth texture--every other brand I've tried gets tough or grainy patches in it.  This product is getting harder to find in supermarkets (and when I do find it it's at a premium price), so the availability on Amazon is great.",5,"A Family Favorite",1211155200,"2011-03-04"

"B001E4Q5WI","The Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy Peanut Butter is still pretty good stuff. It has a nice, smooth texture, just like the regular peanut butter. But there is a distinct difference in taste. The truth is that the regular peanut butter has a richer taste, one in which the peanutty flavor comes through more distinctly. So, if you're on a diet or must watch your fat intake, you'll want to buy the reduced fat variety. But if you're sensitive to the taste, buy the regular.The taste issue doesn't seem to be a problem of you're baking.

I like the smooth texture it has, and it has a great mouth-feel that isn't the thick ""stick to the roof of my mouth"" kind that requires a glass of milk to be able to eat.  I don't feel that Skippy reduced the flavor from its original peanut butter along with the fat to make this product -- it tastes delicious and satisfying.If you're a peanut butter lover like me, please look out for the fantastic prices Amazon has on Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy -- you won't regret buying it, and the reduced fat intake is a bonus!",4,"Tasty, and with reduced fat?

True, some will say this doesn't taste quite right after they've eaten regular peanut butter for some while; but with my current weight issues reduced fat is the way to go for me. I also like the taste and the texture; and the expiration date on the jar is always a way off into the future so this will last awhile unless you eat it several days of the week as I do!As of this time, you may be able to get this product cheaper in your local supermarket or elsewhere.

"B001E4Q5WI","I started buying Skippy several years ago after reading a number of consumer reviews that gave it a top ranking. The one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds, who gave Skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its tastes and texture. In writing this review, I went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. I'm taking the liberty of quoting from the CookingLightly website so far as its review of Creamy:""The roasted peanuts on the ingredient list are evident in the heady aroma and balanced flavor. Testers thought this sample was a touch oily, but spread the best...Makes the perfect peanut butter sandwich, but can turn into a savory dressing when mixed with soy, vinegar, and crushed red pepper to serve over sugar snap peas, broccoli, or a stir-fry. For a sweet version, mix with honey and mayonnaise and use as a fruit salad dressing. Mix with chile paste with garlic (sambal oelek) or sriracha for an easy sauce for roast meats.""This is my opinion, too, and while the above review was for the regular Creamy, it applies in my opinion to the reduced fat version just as well. I love this peanut butter. I know that Jif and Peter Pan are also often ranked highly, but Skippy is by far my preference.While I use it on sandwiches, I often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. It is so good in this role that I gave it to a diabetic friend. She uses it in lieu of orange juice if she's starting to feel hypoglycemic. The peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.I will note that some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of reduced fat peanut butter. They have two ASIC points:1. The process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.2. To compensate for any loss of taste, manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.My rating is based on taste and texture. I'm not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue.",5,"Top of the line so far as reduced fat peanut butters",1289952000,"2011-03-04"

But now that we have the 6 pack, there are so many around the house, that even I was able to try them. And unlike some gluten-free foods, these are really palatable. Especially good with a slathering of peanut butter on top, if your child isn't allergic to nut products, that is. We took a load with us on vacation to Wisconsin Dells, and they proved a delicious, energy-filled breakfast before we hit the waterparks. And on days when my daughter is late getting ready for school, she can just grab a bar for breakfast as I drive her in the car. In short - quick, convenient, delicious, and gluten-casein free.

They are very sweet and provide a quick pick me up or anythime snack. Great for quick breakfast with glass of Soy or Almond milk.  They are covered in chocolate and have a few peanuts for extra flavor and crunch. They are a little sticky compared to regular rice krispy bars , because they use honey and brown rice syrup instead of marshmallows.**gluten free but does have peanuts",5,"Awesomely delicious.

"B001HTGAQQ","I like EnviroKidz' crispy rice bars, but these peanut choco ones are the best!  They have actual bits of peanut mixed in, which gives them a nice little crunch.  One caveat:  Although these bars don't taste overly sweet, they do have 8g of sugar each.  Health food they're not -- but they are a good substitute for candy bars, which tend to be much higher in fat and sugar.Amazon's price is the best I've found thus far, especially if you do the Subscribe & Save option.LATER EDIT:  Just downgraded my rating because the quality of the chocolate drizzle has really gone downhill.

"B001HTGAQQ","Ok, so these are marketed towards kids, lunchboxes etc, but as an adult I say ""Hey why not!"", I can enjoy peanut buttery, chocolate drizzled rice treats in a colorful animal decorated box too, right! So I went for it, and sooooo glad I did. These are delicious and nutritious! I would say these completely satisfy a sweet tooth, and could totally replace a candy bar craving. They fall somewhere between a rice treat and (for anyone who's ever had one, a whatchamacalit bar) essentially, if you like both of those, I'd say you'd definitely do well with these treats. Things of note, there are 120 calories so this is a better choice calorically, and at just 8 sugars it shouldn't spike anyones levels. It only has 1 gram of fiber and 2 grams of protein, but considering it practically tastes like a candy bar it's not so bad. I will say, this item does have brown rice syrup in it and a lot of people are steering clear of that due to the arsenic warnings, but I'd say in moderation it should be reasonably fine. Also, these have soy in them as well for anyone with allergies.

The ones that are gluten free are very often just a bunch of nuts stuck together with honey.What I like best about these bars is that they are made with organic puffed brown rice and peanuts. The nutritional values are decent without sacrificing taste. Not all granola bars with peanuts go over well with my kids. If the peanut flavor is too strong then they reject the stuff instantly. These bars they absolutely love! The chocolate is not too strong either so it makes for a nice blend of flavors.These are a real life saver for us as a quick portable gluten free snack",5,"Great for kids on a Gluten free diet",1264118400,"2009-03-04"

They aren't bland, sickeningly sweet, don't have any odd aftertaste, etc.  The sugar content isn't through the roof.  I love that they're organic and have ingredients that I can pronounce.

"B001HTGAQQ","My children enjoy all the flavors of Envirokids cereals; they especially enjoy reading about each animal featured on the packages and playing a part in the recycling chain around the planet.  When asked to purchase this product for their afternoon snack, I thought we had a better than even chance the product would be tolerable for a health food version of a snack bar. These bars exceeded all expectations. They ship quickly, are very fresh( freshness dates are marked clearly on the package), but the best part is they are delicious! beyond all hope they are better tasting than big name national brand snack bars, (think nutrigrain or nature's valley) The bars just taste like what they are made of instead of great lumps of salt or sugar with a vague sort of processed powdered preservative flavor.",5,"Excellent snack for kids",1371945600,"2009-03-04"
"B001HTGAQQ","These are healthIER than your average kid snack; I'd much rather my kid eat one of these than a pouch of shaped fruit goop.That said, they DON'T taste like Chewy Granola Bars. Which personally, I appreciate. They do have some sugar; they're lightly sweet, because hey! We're attempting to appeal to kids, here! But they're certainly not a candy bar.They're chocolate*Y*, not chocolate. Chocolatey. With a Y. They're sort of like a Rice Krispy treat with some peanuts and the coco-drizzle.They ...don't... taste like other grocery kids' snacks, no indeed. And again, I'm okay with that, because they're not MEANT to be the same as grocery snacks.If your kid had not ever been able to eat a granola bar, these ARE like candy! They do have a different flavor to them. But just different, not bad.If you stick these on a table with Chewy Granola Bars and Froot by the Foot, and Food in a Toob, or whatever, YEAH. Maybe the kids will choose the 100% sugar first.But if for health (or any other) reason, your kid CAN'T EAT THAT CR*P, then these are delicious. It's like getting used to just a lovely chicken breast with lemon pepper after being used to it covered in gravy.Hey. GRAVY ROCKS.

"B001HTGAUM","Great product off the shelf - healthy and tasty.Bad product when shipped through amazon, so far.Both times i've ordered this, the bars come melty and deformed.  Normally i could care less, but the the melted syrup sinks to the bottom of the wrapper and makes the whole thing a sticky mess. So a snack-on-the-go turns into where-is-the-nearest-sink so i can wash my hands.I can only guess why the product ships like this. This has happened twice now, so it's not a fluke, but both times it's been 100+ degree weather.  UPS or whatever company that is shipping this stuff apparently doesn't use refrigerated cabins (not criticizing, just a likely reality), so even if you refrigerate them after they show up at your door, it's too late, as they are already deformed with the melty syrup already pooled at the bottom of the wrapper.Even so, I'm going to order it again in the Fall/Winter months to see if the product holds up better.  If it does, i have a feeling we can chalk it up to weather, and i would just avoid ordering this through Amazon during summer months.  Either way, I'll update this review.**Updated as of Oct 10**Got another shipment in - this batch was not deformed, but the weather has been much more mild.In conclusion, i would avoid ordering this product via Amazon during hot summer months as the product's integrity seems hard to maintain at high temperatures.",3,"I Eat Three Every Day to Help Keep Me Strong",1344384000,"2009-03-02"

Opened the first box and tried a couple bars but they were VERY stale and hard. Threw those away thinking it was just a bad box and opened a second.  Same thing--stale, hard, and completely inedible!  Interesting thing is that the expiration date on these boxes was still 6 months out, so might be a little ""funny business"" going on with date stamp on the packaging, if you know what I mean.  Will NOT order these again and probably hesitant to order another food item since Amazon does not allow returns on food.  Order at your own risk!",1,"Very stale!

"B001HTGAUM","I love this bar and that is probably because I love any treat that combines peanuts and chocolate.  I don't consider this a health bar.  This has a good amount of sugar and a good amount of fat.  I eat them because they are a great cheat treat.  When I eat well all day, I look forward to this soft but chewy bar that has real peanuts and what seems to be real chocolate (I detest bars that proclaim to have real chocolate but instead incorporate a fake chocolaty substance).What I like about this bar:1) The taste - Wow! For a granola bar the taste is phenomenal. The picture on the box does not lie.  You can see peanuts and oats and the chocolate topping tastes awesome.  The texture of the oats/nuts melds well with the oats and nuts.2) Portable and easy to pack - If you try to stay aware of your daily calorie intake, it is always great to have easy to carry snacks with their calories clearly labeled. Who has time to count out the exact number of pretzels that comprise 150 calories? That is part of the appeal of a granola bar. You've got a 150 calorie food item that can be placed in a purse or coat pocket and you are out the door.3) The company has made a conscious effort to reduce packaging in order to reduce impact on the environment.  The box is made of 100% recycled materials.What is questionable about this bar:1) This is a snack/treat bar and nothing else - This is not a healthful nutrition bar. The product packaging does not necessarily say this is healthful. It does use the words ""organic goodness"" and boasts ""9 grams of whole grains"". These notations may make some think this is a really healthy treat. But it's not. The bar has low fiber (2g) and pretty high sugar for a 150 calorie bar (11 grams).2)If you use snacks to hold you over, you probably should find a snack with at least 4 grams of fiber. The 2 gram bar is not going to tide you over very long.If you feed these to your kids, there is a good likelihood they will like them. They are pretty sweet.  But again with the sugar, what else are you giving your kids during the day? Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 3/4 teaspoons in this bar. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this bar may not be worth it to you. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end.Summary:Nature's Path has created a very tasty granola bar with quality ingredients. Props to the company for not saying this was a health or nutrition bar on the box. I am reviewing this as a treat bar and as a treat, it is a delicious option. If it were being reviewed for health, I would not be able to give it four stars as it has high sugar, high fat and low fiber.  Don't expect it to hold you over for hours but do expect it to satisfy your sweet tooth.These granola bars are made in the United States.",4,"Really tasty bar",1299196800,"2009-03-02"
"B001HTGAUM","If your idea of a bar is something sweet and mushy, then go for it. The peanuts and chocolate make a very small fraction of the bar. The rest is just mush. There is no crunch.",1,"Too sweet and mushy",1318636800,"2009-03-02"

"B001HTIVX6","As a lover of green tea (especially if honey is included), I was very curious when I happened across this in a store.  It is AMAZING!I will preface that you have to like the flavor combinations included in this bottle.  While I like it, my mother was less than thrilled (since she's not a huge green tea drinker).  The taste is very light and clean, with the mint taking forefront in the flavor.The only reason I scored it slightly lower is due to the sugar AND the honey.  In most cases, honey is enough of a sweetener to not need sugar included as well.  However, they do use cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, so they definitely get points for that!Great taste, organic (thrown in just in case that's a priority for you), and no fake ingredients make this a winner.

"B001HTJ2BQ","I use coconut milk daily and this is the only coconut milk I buy because I appreciate that Native Forest uses BPA-free cans and is organic.I've been buying this from Amazon for over a year--I used to buy it on subscription before they canceled subscription availability.Up till now there has never been a problem with my orders. But yesterday I received my latest 12 pack and EVERY single can in it is dented. Four had very minor dents near the top, but eight cans had large noticeable dents.While I imagine that the product inside is probably fine, I am very concerned about this lapse in quality control in the manufacturing and/or distibution process. Dents can weaken the metal and introduce tiny cracks that allow contamination of the product.I notice a lot of very recent comments on Amazon stating that others are receiving dented cans as well. I hope Amazon and/or Native Forest will address this.I am not sure if it's a distribution problem--if the cans are being damaged in shipping (they came double boxed from Amazon, so perhaps damage occurs further upstream in the shipping line), or if Amazon is only managing to source damaged cans in the first place, or ...?I want to offer full stars for the product, which I like and truly rely on, but I'm offering a low rating because of the packaging.",1,"All 12 cans dented!

I put the can in the refrigerator (live in SWFL), open from the bottom, pour out the water and just use the cream. Now my most recent shipment is horrible. Most of the cans are dented, and no amount of cooling will separate the cream from the water.

I've purchased this brand before (Native Forest Organic Classic) and the coconut milk was rich and creamy. The BPA-free can was also a strong selling point for me. However, I am VERY disappointed with this last shipment I received. There is a pronounced reduction in quality... watery milk with large gritty chunks of fat. No creaminess at all. I see from the other recent comments that other customers have experienced the same disappointment.The lower price and BPA-free cans become less attractive when you are receiving a sub-standard product... especially a case of it.

It was from Sri Lanka. It is a thin product that becomes greasy when heated. It lacks the thick rich taste I'm used to from Native Forest. Very disappointed.

Since they are one of the few, if only, companies offering BPA-free coconut milk, we stuck with it, but the quality of the product is pretty poor now. It was actually BETTER when it would separate because it actually tasted like coconut milk. You just has to heat it in another container to get it to combine (come on - its an organic product - mother nature didn't produce things for long distance shipping in metal cans and THAT'S OK). Now that they've switched countries of origin, it stays more mixed, but it has NO COCONUT TASTE. It is just a can of guar gum. :(",2,"Used to be better, now is just guar gum",1339113600,"2014-12-26"

I figured I could overlook that, but the can I was holding felt heavy, which was weird, so I opened it.  Totally solid, except for a small amount of coconut water (not milk!) at the bottom - which I only discovered after I scooped out the rest of the product.  Since I use this product to make Green Smoothie Girl's Hot Pink Breakfast Smoothie, I figured I could still use the solid mass (I blend in a BlendTec, which can handle it).  WRONG.  It made our smoothies totally grainy and flat out horrible.  We've been drinking these smoothies for about 6 months now, and really truly like them, but a smoothie made with this product?  Gross.  Totally different.  We gave it a shot, though, and continued using the product for about 2 weeks.  We use 1 can every morning in our smoothies, and each and every smoothie was exactly the same texture: grainy and almost mottled with this coconut milk.  Yuck.  Since I had signed up for Amazon's Subscribe & Save program, I knew I had to cancel my order (2 cases every month) soon, but Amazon was really on top of things and I received my next order over a week early!  Now I had 3 cases of product I didn't want.  Stellar.

"B001HTJ2BQ","After reading the review about dented cans, I was leery to buy 2 cases from Amazon but I am glad I did! I received all 24 cans, and NONE were dented. I was pleasantly surprised! The milk worked for my thai curry quite well, but I just wish it was a bit thicker. While this milk is not as thick as the Mae Ploy brand I have tried in the past, I feel better knowing it was organically grown and that this particular company does not use BPA in their cans for coconut milk, or several other of their products. If more companies jump on the bandwagon I will try more brands but until then I am sticking with Native Forest.Added Aug 15th 2011:I now see lots of negative reviews on this product due to sourcing from both Sri Lanka and Thailand. Reviewers have stated the poor quality watery ones are coming from Sri Lanka, which makes sense why I rated mine a 4 and liked mine, because mine were the Thailand kind that like other reviewers have stated, taste great. So be careful when ordering this product and make sure you get the Thailand kind! (will say this on the back of the label) As there is no way to know which Amazon is shipping out, it seems the best bet is to get them in a local store and check the back and get the good sourcing of coconut milk that will say Thailand.Added Oct 20th, 2012:As commenters have posted as a response to my review, you are able to purchase a powder that you can mix with hot water if you wish to avoid cans at Wilderness Family Naturals website.Another option is the Tropical Traditions website shows how to make coconut milk with dried coconut at home. (They sell organic dried coconut on their website, so avoiding cans, less packaging, ethical sourcing) They sell quality coconut products, I have purchased many of their items.Added Aug 5th, 2013:In the comments section on my review a user posted:""I just called Native & Sons co and they said there is NO detected bpa OR bps in there cans..Good to know!""Lastly, I read recently on someone's blog that you can use the coconut cream concentrate found on the Tropical Traditions website to make coconut milk, that it is very cost effective. I have not ever tried this, however I add a bit to smoothies for my partner in the summer and he loves the taste. If I ever try these things out I will report back, however I just wanted to give ideas to folks who might see this if they do not want to go the canned milk route. :)Added Dec 8th, 2013:If you haven't seen the 2 star review by Erin ""Get Better Wellness""  titled "" Supply Shortage so Product Coming From Sri Lanka not Thailand"" from September 9, 2011 she lists the response from this company about the difference in the Thailand and Sri Lanka coconut milks. While I encourage you to look at her review, this was the response below she got from the company. I am only adding here because its valuable information and most people might not look through all 230+  reviews and comments to find all this but the manufacturer comment credit goes to Erin with the direct quote below. Thanks for contacting the company! ^_^""From the manufacturer:Thank you for writing. Due to worldwide surging demand for coconutmilk during its lean harvest season, our primary organic packer inThailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales. Therefore wehave added a trusted organic coconut facility in Sri Lanka as oursecondary supplier. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka uses a slightly differentprocessing method than Thailand does and the Sri Lankan product hasmore tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degreesF. This makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separatesfrom the liquid. Such separation is harmless and easily remedied byplacing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and thenstirring the contents thoroughly. We regret this inconvenience,especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother,creamier consistency of our Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. Whileall natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cooltemperatures, the Thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous. Facedwith lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconutseason, we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistenciesfrom two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at allduring this six month lean period.

"B001HTJ2BQ","We have a pretty good supply of coconut milk with no stabilizers here in Illinois. But the stores had run out of it and I needed some coconut milk. I'm glad that the guar gum is organic, but it's still freakin' guar gum.

Yes, the cream solidifies in cooler weather, which can be an advantage. For example, you can purposely refrigerate the can, then scoop out the thick, cold cream, add sweetener and use like whipped cream. It's delicious. The cream is also great in coffee as creamer.

"B001HTJ2BQ","I have never had the need to make a negative review - Amazon has always done extraordinarily right by me since their inception. I invest a lot of money with this company, and have always been pleased and felt safe purchasing food items until now.This Seller, the true culprit here, is fraudulently shipping dented and unbelievably dangerous cans of coconut milk - and not even of the Native Forest Organic Classic brand. I received the Grace brand.Every single can - 12 cans - was deeply dented. I had already decided not to purchase the Grace name brand after much recearch.That said, I opened a can, and the smell was the first thing that assailed me. It resembled something dead - not the delightful smell of coconut milk. Of course it was dramatically separated - completely unlike the coconut milk from Thailand. I highly reccommend the Thai brand, just for general principle.Back to this dangerous Seller's switch from Native Forest to Grace. I then poured the hard multi-colored blob of - in hindsight - obviously spoiled coconut milk into a bowl along with the abundance of noxious fluid, and covered my nose as I attempted to whip it into what never became a lovely thick milk, as true coconut milk is, and placed it on the floor to see if my German Shepherd - who will eat any human food I allow - would eat this; he loves coconut milk, probably more than me.He approached it as if it were anything but a food item, smelled it, and ran from the bowl, huffing and snorting in an attempt to clear his nose. He looked at me the remainder of that day as if I had tried to harm him, shying away from my constant attempts at comforting him. Now understand this is no ordinary German Shepherd, but an enormous, beatific, trained, intelligent dog, who I put to Sire as an International Grand Champion. That's how special he is. I feel incredibly guilty to have put him in a potentially deadly situation now - all because of this Seller. Thank God he is as intelligent as he is.This Seller is dangerous. A new purchaser, unfamiliar with what safe coconut milk looks and smells like could even die. I have no doubt these cans are likely full of salmonella or some other bacteria that could, at minimum, make a person ill upon ingestion. All 12 Grace cans dented deeply, yet all still placed in the specially designed shipping box, undeniably after this Seller knew he/she/it was shipping damaged and spoiled items in place of another Brand no less? Come on, Folks. This is the Seller, not Amazon.Don't blame Amazon, please - they refunded my purchase cost immediately; I simply called them.

"B001HTJ2BQ","I bought these because I heard that Thai Kitchen uses BPA.

"B001HTJ2BQ","I normally buy one of these two:Natural Value Coconut MilkorNatural Value Organic Coconut Milk. But they are out-of-stock at Amazon. So at my local store I bought a couple cans of this one.At one time none of the coconut milks had guar gum. Then one added it. Then all the others followed suit. You could no longer buy any without it. Then along comes Natural Value with a pure coconut milk.Guar gum is a legume. People following the paleo diet generally avoid legumes. And some people find guar gum to be a laxative. It is added as it is an stabalizer. Without it you have to do a lot of vigorous stirring to get it all mixed up.But the downside is with the guar gum you get a thin and slimy milk. The Natural Value is thicker, and if chilled in the refrigerator you can spoon it on as a topping. This has the consistency of a beverage.",3,"Thin and Slimy",1372032000,"2014-12-26"

"B001HTJ2BQ","I use a lot of coconut milk: prefer organic with non BPA cans so the best one I'm accustomed to using is Native Forest coconut milk.

One box was ok, the other one had every single can crushed!  I don't even buy dented cans, those were beyond dented.  The boxes were put in a large one with other items, big outside box was ok, so it's not the shipping damage to me.  The ripped and damaged box of it was already this way at the warehouse.  So I'm not buying it again here.My normal rating of this milk is 3 stars (It's ok) less one star for having crushed cans.  Taste is 4 stars, but down to 3 since there is added water and guar gum (so added water to make it cheaper, added guar gum to make it thicker again since it got thinned out by water???)

It is an excellent product from a responsive company.  It has been improved -- no Sri Lanka, no BPA (expensive testing), and (in my observation) higher fat content.  BESIDES all that, the price would drop if you people wouldn't give it such great ratings/reviews and just keep it a secret....... 12/8/2013 UPDATE: Current Price $29.88, so it dropped $9.40 in 7 weeks....... That is basically same price I paid on March 24, 2012 and on June 16, 2013....... Lowest I've paid was $22 December 28, 2012.  LESSON to be learned here --...... watch the price and buy low if you're a habitual user like me.  I'll check...... when it arrives, and if anything has changed, I'll update this again....... I'm still wondering why I keep extolling the virtues of this product....... If demand goes up, so will the price............. 1/6/2014 UPDATE: Received latest case on Dec 9, 2013....... No dented cans.  No BPA.  From Thailand....... Waited until I got into 2nd can to report. It's the best I've ever had....... Over 2/3 content and the fat is white as snow.  Taste is wonderful,...... meaning almost no taste at all in the fat -- just a little sweet with a...... slight coconut hint.  I refrigerate it (see more on that below), so I...... just spoon out the fat I need, then pour out some water.  Mix-in solids...... first if not using a blender or heating.  The remainder goes in a pint...... jar, sealed tight.  I label the date.  The first can was still good on...... the 17th day.  I normally do not try and keep it over 2 weeks after...... opening.  Use only clean spoons, don't let anything get into it, and...... don't leave the cap off or keep it out of the 'fridge any longer than...... you have to.  If it's nearing the end of the 2 weeks, look near the end...... of this review for the signs it might be turning to the Dark Side............. 6/23/2014 UPDATE:  PRICE ANALYSIS............ FIRST -- HOW MUCH FAT IN THE CAN?...... After seeing usual first-quarter seasonal price jump, I was dismayed to...... see many reports that fat content was way down.  I actually cancelled...... my order and will wait until fall.  If the Edwards and Sons canneries...... in Thailand are shorting the cans because coconuts are in short supply,...... I hope some customers complained.  I would not accept any product that...... didn't match its label....... The labels show grams of 10 fat per serving, ""about"" 7 servings per...... container.  I just have to take that ""about"" as meaning between 6.5...... and 7.5, giving a +/- 7% tolerance to these estimates....... So, 70g of fat per can, give or take 7%....... That and the price per can is all we need to find $/fat-gram and...... compare prices between brands.  Please let me know if I've missed...... something here....... But, for benefit of looking at that fat layer (in the can, not the...... waist), we need to convert can contents from milliliters to grams....... Per Chempro, the specific gravity of the oil (fat) is 0.917-0.919 @ 25C....... Can holds 398ml.  Not wanting to dust off my algebra, lets just make...... the fat 20% by volume.  Then you have 80% at SG of 1 (the water) and...... 20% at SG of 0.918.  Ave. SG = .2(0.918) + .8(1) = 0.9836.  This means...... the contents are slightly lighter than water, so the 398ml can holds...... 0.9836 * 398 or 391g.  You can see that the fat qty is not going to...... make much difference in the weight (OK, mass) of the can contents............. The 70g of fat per label divided by 391g of contents means 18% of the...... can must be fat after refrigerating to separate.  The useable can...... height is 4.14"".  4.14 * 0.18 = 0.74 or almost 3/4"" of fat....... Strange that the cans I bought in Dec. were at least 60% fat and the...... label was the same.

Here is there answer, dated Jan. 10, 2014:""Dear Mr. Creech,""Thank you for your email. We actually never used to put a BPA Free Seal on our can, and we are unlikely to print 'BPA-Free' on cans until the FDA establishes a standard of identity for the 'BPA-Free' statement. To help explain our thinking, let's consider another claim that now appears on some of our packaging: 'Gluten Free'.""According to Wikipedia: 'The legal definition of the phrase 'gluten-free'varies from country to country. Current research suggests that for persons with celiac disease the maximum safe level of gluten in a finished product is probably less than 0.02% (200 parts per million) and possibly as little as 0.002% (20 parts per million). Australian standards reserve the 'gluten free'label for foods with less than 5 parts per million (5ppm) of gluten, as this is the smallest amount currently detectable'. The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) proposed that gluten must not be found at a minimum detection level of 20 ppm before a food may be designated as 'gluten-free'. FDA presented this proposal for public comment on August 3, 2011.""So, to recap, FDA is leaning towards USA adoption of the international standard for 'Gluten-Free', which is 20 ppm. Australia has a stricter standard of 5ppm. Edward & Sons' items must test 'negative' for gluten at the 5ppm detection limit before we will make the Gluten Free (GF) claim on packaging of those items.""However, when it comes to BPA, there is NO USA OR INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR THE TERM 'BPA-FREE'. We do not want to confuse or mislead consumers by establishing a standard of our own. We realize that it is impossible to prove the absence of anythng. All we can demonstrate is that the substance in question -- in this case, BPA -- is not detectable at the limits of our analysis. Before we will add a can to our 'No BPA Detected'list, that can has tested negative for BPA to a lower limit of 0.2 parts per million (for our new coconut milk lining it is 0.1 ppb). We admit, that's a pretty small amount. Nevertheless, we think it best to wait for the US FDA or a reputable International regulatory body to specify a standard for the 'BPA-Free' claim before we add that declaration to our cans.""Best Regards,Hannah Stonecypher""(Edward & Sons Trading Co.)I hope this settles the BPA matter, but it will probably surface again.GUAR GUM[revised 11/21/13 to include this]  Per mfr, product contains ""a tiny amount (less than 1%) of organic guar gum from seeds of the guar plant.""  That works out to about 3.5 grams per can if the &lt;1% is by weight.  Since it's a powder, by volume it would be much less.  This is used an emulsifier.  (If more than 1% it could be a thickening agent.)  Some people with intestinal trouble report problems from guar gum.  In larger quantities (and I suspect in dry form, sometimes used for weight loss), it can cause gas, diarrhea, or, in some cases, constipation.  Also in larger quantities, it can interfere with the action of the drug Metformin (Glucophage), used to control blood sugar in diabetics.  Keep in mind that this guar gum is already diluted.  It's already absorbed as much water as it can.  It is not going to expand anymore in your gut.Guar gum has no toxicity.  I'm certain that 3.6 grams (if you drank a whole can) will not cause a problem for most people.  If you have a sensitivity to guar gum, you'll probably already know it.  There's a lot more in ice cream, for instance.  A gluten-free Website says ""guar gum and xanthan gum are two of the most well-known ingredients in gluten free cooking.""  One reason I know this Native Forest product contains very little guar gum is that it is not very emulsified.  If you break up the fat and shake it up, it will separate again in 24 hrs at room temp.DENTED CANS(1) This is shipping damage caused by slack pickers, sorters, handlers, loaders, or delivery drivers.  Inspect all pkgs ASAP upon receipt.  I you see any damage, go to Your Account to report this and ask for a return authorization.  [See reviewer's statements about returns titled ""Sri Lanka - UPDATED"" by Tyler Fenby on August 23, 2011.  As of this writing, it's under ""Most Helpful"" reviews](2) Is the dent so bad that wall may be weakened and thus leak; so sharp that the lining is broken and the product is exposed to the bare metal; or so distorted that it will be hard to open?If no to all above, there is only one problem IMHO*.  That is if the contents spoil, the internal pressure might not pop out the ends.  Now how many people even know that is why the ends of cans have the concentric ridges?  For that matter, when's the last time anyone has seen a can with popped-out ends?APPEARANCE AND STORAGE OF COCONUT MILK or CREAMI have gone through 3.8 cases, 12 ea, of Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk in the last 21 mo.  That's 4.8 gal.  Yum.  Before I discovered this at Amazon, I bought it off the shelf where I could find it and paid more for less quality.  I figure 10 gallons of the stuff over 4 years.  In that period, for whatever reason, my LDL (bad) cholesterol has gone down & HDL & triglycerides are up.What I have found is that the fat content varies some between cases and even between cans to a lesser degree.  (BTW, fat is what most people WANT when buying coconut milk or cream.)  My current batch is less than half liquid and the rest is pure white cream (fat).  I have seen as little as 1/4 fat, so this is an improvement.  I would suggest that if you're not seeing at least 25% fat (refrigerate to separate) that you contact Edward & Sons and if they do not satisfy your concerns, contact Amazon.  Maybe you could get a refund if it came to that.Regardless of what you've read, I've found that it keeps longer if refrigerated from when you get it until you consume it.  It you want it mixed, break up the fat with a spoon & shake it.  If going in a smoothie or other blended recipe, there's no need to break it up.  Just get as much fat as you want off the top, then make a hole with the spoon to get the liquid you want.If your recipe needs it better emulsified, let the amount you're going to use immediately to warm a little and mix again.  Do NOT HEAT coconut milk/cream unless cooking with it.  It will break down and not keep as long.  Heating most food also breaks down nutrients.  Keep in mind this is an organic product with no preservatives.  After opening a can, transfer any unused amount immediately to a clean pint jar with a tight-fitting lid, label with the date, and return to 'fridge.  I have found it will last 2-3 weeks like this.It's very easy to tell when it is starting to ""turn"" . . .-- by sight: Grayish tint swirled or layered in liquid and more stages of separation than just liquid & fat,-- by smell: slightly fermented odor,-- and by taste: too ""coconutty"".My last (12/12) case before this one would keep 3 weeks in plastic container after opening.  When I noticed the current batch (6/13) was keeping only 10 days or so, I moved remaining cans to 'fridge and started using the glass jar.  The last 8 cans stored like this have lasted 2 - 3 weeks (maybe would be longer as I've not had any go past about 16 days before consuming).(*Re: bent cans) This is what I learned years ago when in the grocery business while in college.  That was before any cans were lined except for varnish that was probably worse than BPA or galvanizing (zinc) when contents were acid, e.g. tomatoes.  Pineapple still comes in zinc-plated cans.  Of course, real ""tin"" cans were either made of tin or an alloy of tin or tin-plated steel.  Now they're all steel or the more expensive aluminum.  I suspect this is because steel with a coating is cheaper than tin plating.  Early cans had tin/lead solder on the seams.  This is what caused so many stupid radio talk show hosts.",5,"All you need to know about Native Forest Organic Classic Coconut Milk",1382313600,"2014-12-26"
"B001HTJ2BQ","I'm happy with this product for 2 reasons.  One:  This is my second case order and I know and like the quality of this coconut milk.

"B001HTJ2BQ","I love their product from Thailand.  I don't like the product from Sri Lanka.The content of coconut oil is higher in Sri Lanka made coco milk, throwing off the consistency.I don't want to have to warm the coconut oil prior to using in a cold smoothie,it will just chunk up anyway.  Wrote the manufacturer - here's the replyFrom the manufacturer:Thank you for writing. Due to worldwide surging demand for coconutmilk during its lean harvest season, our primary organic packer inThailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales. Therefore wehave added a trusted organic coconut facility in Sri Lanka as oursecondary supplier. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka uses a slightly differentprocessing method than Thailand does and the Sri Lankan product hasmore tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degreesF. This makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separatesfrom the liquid. Such separation is harmless and easily remedied byplacing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and thenstirring the contents thoroughly. We regret this inconvenience,especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother,creamier consistency of our Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. Whileall natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cooltemperatures, the Thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous. Facedwith lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconutseason, we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistenciesfrom two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at allduring this six month lean period. We are only shipping Thai sourcedcoconut milkas of right now, but distributors and stores may still have Sri Lankansourced product.Thank you for your patience and your understanding.Sincerely,Joanna FreetEdward & Sons Trading Co., Inc.",2,"Supply Shortage so Product Coming From Sri Lanka not Thailand",1315526400,"2014-12-26"

With disdain for the TK coconut milk she found in my cupboards, she suggested that I spring for the Native Forest coconut milk. I did and oh my goodness it is like an entirely different product. It tastes so, so, so, so much better than any of the under $2 a can brands I've been using in my curry for years.Since switching to this brand, I've started using much more coconut milk. I've substituted it for cow dairy in my smoothies and mashed potatoes which is far better for my health and tastes better, too!As for this delivery, I've only gotten one delivery, but it was super fast, well packaged, and from Thailand.

They have a different supplier in Sri Lanka which waters down the milk -- the cans sound like water when you shake them, not like thick creamy coconut milk (as in the Thailand cans).  And it is NOT that the flesh settles to the bottom -- it is watery all the way through.

"B001HTJ2BQ","Have had this brand a year or two ago and it was creamy, delicous, and good.  Then I ordered Rolands organic coconut milk for a great price on Amazon and really enjoyed it as well-- thick, creamy coconut flavor.  When it was time to reorder Rolands I found reviews stated that quality had changed, so I thought I'd return to a brand I trusted.  It seems the quality of many have changed recently, not sure why.In this specific batch, the milk was a bit more watery and oily.  I just use a portion of the can daily in smoothies, so when I refrigerate the remaining milk, the distinct oil separates and forms a hard layer on top.  Whereas, previous coconut milk would behave more like unhomogenized milk, and thick cream would collect on top (not a slab of ""butter"").",2,"quality has changed, oil separated, not creamy",1311984000,"2014-12-26"

"B001HTJ2BQ","After reading about the issue of BPA in the lining of canned goods, I pledged to avoid any products that I couldn't verify had BPA free cans. In addition, I prefer to buy organic whenever I can, not only for health reasons, but to support that type of agriculture. My search for BPA free coconut milk led me to Native Forest, which is the only brand I found which is both organic and comes in BPA free cans.If you've been buying the Thai Kitchen brand, you'll find the Native Forest brand a bit of a change in terms of texture. Instead of having a chunky coconut cream layer on top and a watery white layer down below, the Native Forest brand is more evenly blended and has a much more creamy consistency right out of the can. This makes it better for cold dressings or sauces, or uses where you don't want a distinct separation between the chunky coconut cream and the thick liquid. I love to pour it over curry with rice noodles as a healthy and flavorful garnish.Because my local stores all charge an arm and a leg for this brand of coconut milk, I was delighted to find it available on Amazon with prime shipping. This is a great product, I've been ordering it exclusively from Amazon for about six months, and I've never had a problem, except for the time when one or two cans arrived with very mild dents in the side. It wasn't a big deal, I just use those cans first.I highly recommend this product.

Just disappointed, since I can make all those things either way without guar gum being in there.

For flavor and texture, I recommend Chaokoh (but unfortunately it is not sold in BPA-free cans).",1,"Yuck",1403654400,"2014-12-26"
"B001HTJ2BQ","Where I come from ""bait & switch"" is called fraud.I thought that surely by now Amazon.com would have corrected this ""bait & switch"" problem of offering a premium coconut milk from Thailand, but then sending an inferior ""oil & water'"" product from Skri Lanka, since there were lots of reviews warning about this.I had carefully verified that what I was ordering was truly from Thailand-but it is NOT! It is from Skri Lanka, instead.ALSO, the product I received from Skri Lanka was in the old style yellow lined (Phenol lined?) cans-the yellow kind with the white stripe down the side that theoretically products you from the metals they use to seal the can! (And I am allergic to the chemical phenol!)The Thailand product comes in a silver colored can-I opened both products today and did the comparision side by side.So not only is Amazon.com allowing a bait & switch to happen, they are allowing an older style (a potentially harmful style) of can to be sold.I had to use a couple of cans for a party tonight, but I will not eat it!I have asked for my money back and cancelled by subscription, and will buy the rich creamy Thailand coconut milk from my health food store!",1,"Bait & Switch fraud!",1314921600,"2014-12-26"

"B001HTJ2BQ","I received the coconut sourced from Thailand (apparently the Sri Lanka ones are completely different products), and found it to be outstanding.  I've been using coconut milk for a few years now to make paleo-friendly curries, and it's been getting more and more difficult to find quality coconut milk.  The product I received is perfect--mostly cream with only a little liquid, not the thin, oily mixture that seems to be showing up in my cans these days.  I noticed that other reviewers are unhappy with this product's very thick consistency, but this is what full fat coconut milk is SUPPOSED to be like.

"B001HTJ2BQ","I started buying this product in January and it was thick, creamy and delicious.  I needed a hand blender to mix the thick cream with the milk and enjoyed using it to make puddings, etc.  Then, in the Spring the product changed dramatically for the worse.  As previous reviewers stated, they started sourcing the milk from Sri Lanka instead of Thailand and the end product was thin, watery and had little clumps of fat that would not and could not be blended into the milk.  I called the customer service and they advised me to wait before buying more until the can once again said that it was a product of Thailand.  So, a few weeks ago, I was delighted to see that the cans at my local health food store once again stated that they were a ""product of Thailand"".  However, the product is still not the same product as it was before the change in sourcing.  While it is back to having a creamy like consistency, it is noticeably thinner.  Instead of needing a spoon, it pours right out of the can with the same consistency and thickness of light cream.  I can no longer use it to make puddings, etc because it is too thin.  It's as if someone watered down the product.  I called the company once again and they had absolutely no explanation for this change in thickness.  For a comparison, I also bought a can of the Thai Kitchen brand coconut milk (also sourced from Thailand) and it was exceptionally thick and creamy, about twice the thickness as the Native Forest.  So, until someone can give me a good explanation as to why the new coconut milk is so thin, I will switch to the Thai Kitchen brand.  What a shame, since this used to be a great product.",2,"Be aware of the changes that have been made!!",1317168000,"2014-12-26"
"B001HTJ2BQ","I've been receiving this through Subscribe & save for nine months, and the quality of my last two cases has decreased....the change in the last batch was minor, but this batch is really sad.The original product was high-quality with a thick layer of coconut ""cream"" on top in temperatures over 74 degrees and a pudding-like consistency after mixing when stored in the refrigerator.  This last batch is watery from the can, liquid from the fridge, and oddly sweet for ""unsweetened"" coconut milk.I'm aware that the price for coconut oil and flesh has risen dramatically or late, and I can only guess that this decline in quality is Native Forest's attempt to continue providing organic coconut milk at a reasonable price.  There is no set ratio for how much coconut flesh is in a can of coconut milk, which is pureed coconut flesh blended with water.  Higher quality brands typically provide a higher ratio of flesh to water, low quality brands are sometimes made only with ""coconut extract"".  I can only hope that when coconut prices level out, this brand will return to its formerly excellent quality.",3,"Quality waaaay down as of 6/11/11",1313366400,"2014-12-26"

"B001HTJ2BQ","I was ordering Native Forest Coconut Milk from Amazon quite frequently. It was the most delectable coconut milk I could find anywhere. The five star reviews were spot on. Loved it!Then all the sudden I started receiving a completely different product in a can with the same label. It seemed like very, VERY watered down coconut milk with coconut oil added to it. The result was a liquid with oil solids (translucent like coconut oil) throughout. It didn't matter how much I shook the can (or heated the unopened can in hot water before shaking) it was a disgusting, unusable, oily slop! If I refrigerated an open can the oil would rise to the top and form a solid top layer. I've never seen any other brand of coconut milk do this.The cans do say ""Product of SRI LANKA"" in spite of the Amazon listing stating it is from Thailand. I suspect this it the reason for the poor quality. I would bet that the cans that have labels stating it was from Thailand are the real Native Forest Coconut Milk and the Sri Lanka cans are some sort of evil Doppelg&auml;nger!UPDATE 3/15/2012Due to new reviews I decided to give the product a try once again. Looks like Amazon or Native Forest has addressed the issue of the inferior product from Sri Lanka. I have recieved several 12 packs and all have been from Thailand, all have been super creamy and delicious. Thank goodness.

The cans were all packed tightly in a box, which was then placed within a second box for delivery. As for the product itself, I had been using a coconut milk from a carton that was smooth and did not separate. This coconut milk separates into the coconut water and coconut cream, so when the can is opened, the harder coconut cream is on top and the water is underneath. Since I only use 1 serving at a time (1/4 cup) this means dividing the cream and coconut water separately. I tried blending it in a blender but it still did not blend together.

As others have mentioned, they are currently sending out cans that were processed in Sri Lanka. I do not know if they are processing it differently or if the coconuts are just regionally different, but it is a big difference in flavor.

The consistency changes throughout the year, as I've found with all coconut milk. It's usually very smooth and rich, with a fair amount of cream at the top at room temperature. Sometimes in the winter, I'll get a batch with mostly cream and very little liquid.

Well, no surprise.  This time I also received dented cans.  The cans are packaged in sturdy cases and packing around the cases.  The cans had to have been dented when they were crated.  I would never purchase dented cans.  I will not be ordering any more from Amazon.  I will purchase at local stores even though the price is higher.  I will be able to see the cans and know they are not dented.  This speaks poorly of Amazon, Native Forest and Thai.  I am a very dissatisfied customer.",1,"dented cans",1395619200,"2014-12-26"

"B001HTJ2BQ","Our son has a dairy allergy, so we use a lot of coconut milk. I usually mix canned coconut milk with water, vitamins, protein powder, and probiotics, and he drinks it in place of cow's milk. We don't buy the aseptic cartons because of additives and fillers. I like that the Native Forest is BPA-free, but the milk itself isn't as thick or easy to mix as the Whole Foods 365 brand (which I think has guar gum and might explain the difference). WF has been unreliable about coconut milk availability of late, so we order this as a backup when we can't get cases of the 365. It doesn't last as long, but he doesn't seem to mind the taste, so I'm guessing it's all about the same. It tastes the same as 365 with cooking. It's definitely better than Thai kitchen and a lot thicker than the Royal Star brand they sell at Walmart (which isn't organic or BPA-free).",3,"Okay as a substitute",1395446400,"2014-12-26"

I'm on keto and would go through a can a day,but with this brand 21 carbs is way too much. And I can not return it,plus the benefit of other brands is the thick cream separates from the water which I like,but this brand is unnaturally smooth and fluid no lumps nothing.Very disappointed,and I'm not allowed to return the cans,so I have high carb crap sitting around.",1,"Very high in carbs",1374278400,"2014-12-26"

"B001HTJ2BQ","After trying this coconut milk from the local store a couple years ago, I decided to buy future cans through Amazon - resulting in a moderate savings. I chose it because it was tasty, high quality, and BPA free. I had gone through about 2-3 boxes; no complaints.Then they shipped me an order that was manufactured in Sri Lanka, not Thailand as the others were. Apparently this is due to a shortage. That would be fine if the taste was the same, but are you kidding me with this quality control!? The taste and texture are horrible. It's like they added powdered and freeze dried coconut milk to dirty water. It completely ruined the smoothie I added it to.I now will be throwing away 11.5 cans of this stuff, as I didn't get to it before the return window. I don't know what the risk of getting another case from Sri Lanka is, but I'm not taking a chance. I'll be buying Native Forest from the local store from now on.

"B001HTJ2BQ","I had to temporarily give up dairy so I found a chocolate coconut milk ice cream recipe to take the place of dairy ice cream.

I place the separated coconut milk in a large wide mouth jar and add a bit of organic vanilla and stevia. and whip it with my electric mixing wand.  It turns into whipped cream that tastes quite like the real thing.  I add it to coffee,  which tastes wonderful and also to hot chocolate, fruit and with whatever you would use whipped cream.  The temperature needs to be ...  not too soft and not too hard.  Which is not difficult to achieve.

"B001HTJ2BQ","I got this over a month ago (February 2014), so I can't return it. I had a case ordered, and just didn't need to get into it right away.The first can I opened had a dent in the side, and when I opened it, instead of the creamy texture I got the watery grainy texture that suggested the milk had gone bad. I went ahead and used it after the sniff test, but was uneasy, so I decided to check another can and see if the milk was better. NINE CANS had a dent in the side, some much worse than others. It's also packed in a box with slots, designed to protect the cans, so this means to me that dented cans were purposely packed into the box. The box itself had no damage to it, neither did the cardboard slots.I had already cancelled my subscription because I don't need a ton of this but I am appalled at the quality of product I received.

The cans do say Thailand product.  At this point it's a toss-up as to whether I can use the product, as several of the dents are around the can lids, raising the question as to product safety.

Also, unlike the Thai Kitchen brand, there is not a thick layer of cream at the top, which I actually do like. This seemed kind of watery for being ""classic"" and not the light version.

I saw other reviewers said it has to do with whether the cans came from Sri Lanka or Thailand.  I will not be ordering these from amazon.

"B001HTJ2BQ","I cannot use dairy and have been using coconut 'everything' for a long time.  By FAR the BEST coconut milk EVER, is this: Native Forest Organic CLASSIC Coconut Milk!!  But, it HAS TO BE THE ONE FROM THAILAND!!!  I had one BAD experience, and I found it to be BECAUSE it had come from Sri Lanka.  During the Summer months, you can shake the can before opening, (although I still use a can opener and pour it in a covered Pyrex bowl to refrigerate), you can actually pour it right out of the can. However, during the WINTER months, the coconut will be solidified, and the water with the guar gum, will STAY LIQUID, therefore, SEPARATED. Once I carefully pour it in the Pyrex bowl, I use a fork to 'mix' the milk to what is 'well enough' for what I use it for. If I would intend to drink it, I would use a hand mixer, on low to avoid splattering... not that I have tried it yet, but I assume it would work. Anyone who is interested in the EXCELLENT benefits of coconut oil, ought to always go for the CLASSIC.  There's nothing better than this brand for 'the CLASSIC ORGANIC COCONUT MILK'.

"B001HTJ2BQ","So, after reading every review, I checked to see that the country of origin listed in the description was Thailand. I tried not one but a replacement case as well, both a horribly greasy product from Sri Lanka. Amazon immediately reimbursed me. I had used this product before (not from Amazon) and my cans must have been from Thailand as the product is (was)so dreamy I really wanted it again.I decided to call the company because their description on Amazon is false advertising. The woman I spoke to was an absolute brat, borderline rude, with excuse after excuse. Maybe she was tired of fielding complaints, but isnt' that her job? I was so surprised because I have had such great conversations and learned so much from other small companies like that--like Nutiva (who I complained to about my leaking coconut oil and devleoped a great relationship with one of the representatives there who sent me a replacement even though I told him Amazon had already reembursed me. I just wanted to let them know about the problem.Her biggest excuse (among several side-stepping maneuvers) is that the sample sent to them did not match the product. To me this speaks VOLUMES about the lack of quality control at the company. Makes me wonder what is in those cans. So, Amazon and other poor consumers will have to suffer for Edward and Sons faulty business products until the Sri Lankan is used up 'in about another month or so'. Seriously?A small company with poor customer service is doomed to fail, no matter how great their product.

It was as good as Natural Value Organic (you can see my review hereNatural Value Organic Coconut Milk Lite, 14 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)), which is now more expensive than this Native Forest.  However, I just got two cases and it is no longer half liquid, half solid as it should be.  Now, it is thin, almost homogenized, along the lines of something like ""light"" coconut milk.

They informed me that they had already discontinued their sourcing (this was around September 2011), and that the only remaining cans were those already stocked. It now being February 2012, I decided to give them another shot. I'm SO glad that I did, too, because theirs is easily the best coconut milk I've ever had--now that it's properly sourced from Thailand, that is. Those of you who were concerned about getting any from Sri Lanka should be safe now. Additionally, it seems that while they once weren't accepting returns for this item, you can get a replacement if the cans are dented and you call Amazon. And if they're from Sri Lanka, you can be sure they're going to be dented!Old (1 star) review:Another warning for anyone who orders this: if you get the cans from Sri Lanka, they WILL be watery, and they WILL be dented, and they're NOT eligible for a return.You have been warned.",5,"Sri Lanka - UPDATED",1314057600,"2014-12-26"

I made a shake of it with protein powder and I was delicious.I would like to comment on some of the reviewers here if I may, no insulting just making observations.1) It is sad that the cans came in dented but that is not the fault of Amazon the case comes from the manufacturer in a sealed box, Amazon does not pack it, so if the product is dented inside the box it is the fault of the packers.2) Why would you believe that there is no BPA? just because someone's friend read it somewhere? It is not stated on the can along with, the claims of NON GMO, Kosher, USDA organic, Vegan, Gluten Free.  If it were indeed BPA free they would want to put it on the label with these other claims because it would boost sales.  So it is not BPA free.3) the expiration date is clearly marked on the bottom of each can as well as the case it comes in, mine reads this way: Best Before : 21 FEB 2013, under that it has a number of 05, I think that is where that person got the 07 from he missed the real date or it was rubbed off somehow.  It is hard to believe that all 24 got rubbed off.We all have different tastes  and unfortunately in a business this large there are mistakes, contact the company but please do not give negative reviews if you have not tasted the product at all.

"B001KPB2RY","First, we did not buy this product through Amazon. I believe my husband bought it from Vitacost.These are delicious, at least in the opinion of someone who has been on all kinds of restricted diets for years. They are a bit sweet for me, but I think I follow a relatively low-sugar diet and my sense of ""sweetness"" may very well be more acute than average. With all my limitations, they are a good find, and I'll keep buying them and enjoying them one at a time.Also, as I have found with other gluten-free baked goods, the texture is crumblier than that of its wheatier namesakes.They taste very rich, a little like a Reeses peanut butter cup.

"B001M073SO","I make my own Middle Eastern and South Asian spice mixes but am too unfamiliar with Latin cuisine to make my own.  This seasoning saves me and makes mine and my husband's family think I am a master in many cuisines.  I am actually not, but they ask me my secret and I don't tell them, lol.  This spice combination is exotic for them and they always request &#34;my&#34; Hispanic and Southwestern food.  I have two full cabinets of nothing but spices and this is one of the few prepared mixes I keep stocked.  It's awesome.  I do add more cumin and tomato boullion to whatever I use this in - always.",5,"A great spice mix",1394064000,"2015-01-26"
"B001M073SO","These seasoning packs are an essential component in the arsenal of any person aiming to emulate Latin-American cuisine. I recommend them to anyone that wants to accentuate the flavor of dishes such as carne con papa, ajiaco, ropa vieja, and picadillo. The flavor is slightly bitter with a hint of zest. Sazon also transforms the texture of food - in particular sauces- providing them with a savory thickness and the distinct red color (created by achiote), which most people attribute to Sazon.One more thing I would like to point out. There is currently no evidence pointing to MSG being harmful for consumption. The anti-MSG stigma was spawned from a 1960s research study that was based on anecdotal evidence. MSG (Monosodium glutamate) is an abundant, naturally-occurring non-essential amino-acid that shares an identical chemical compound to ham and cheese. A small portion of people that consume food seasoned with MSG experience symptoms. The only problem with MSG is that it makes food delicious, so you will eat more.",5,"Make all your food taste authentic.",1395532800,"2015-01-26"

This seasoning made a perfect broth.  My first attempt at paella was disappointing, but this perked it up the next day.  If you want an easy way to fix mussels and clams, just add a packet or two of this seasoning to water in a large, wok-style pan.  The mussels and clams will open in the savory broth and you can serve them right from the pan.  Delicious!",5,"Makes a flavorful broth for paella with mussels and clams!",1330560000,"2015-01-26"

Bet you anything she's got boxes of this stocked in her kitchen, too!

I moved to the West Coast and cannot find it in stores out here so I am very happy I am able to order it online through Amazon - if not I would be really depressed. There is nothing like Sazon, it makes EVERYTHING taste fantastic! I use it on Chicken, Steak, Beef and Vegetables. When I'm getting low I become sad because without it everything tastes so bland. I like that this seasoning adapts to what you use it on so the flavor is delicious but the food doesn't taste the same. If you're a fan of rice and beans I highly recommended using this with Goya Sofrito and Recaito. You will make the BEST rice and beans ever. All you need is :2 packs SazonA can of Red Kidney Beans1 half of chopped onion2 tablespoons Recaito2 tablespoons SofritoMix all ingredients in a sauce pan on medium heat for 10-15 minutes.

What an amazing little packet of wonderful!!!Here in the Deep South we eat a lot of fresh vegetables and dry peas and beans.  One packet of Sazon added to the water with peas and beans brings them to a whole new level that I never knew existed.

As part of that same &#34;fluffy/powdery&#34; issue, when shaken into a hot dish (such as soup or stew), it doesn't dissolve in the same fashion as the type of dried garlic I've used in the past.

"B001VNGMDE","i am used to granulated garlic and got this by mistake. however, i have still never had garlic powder that was ground up so fine. it is more like a dust, which makes it hard to use. it is hard to tap out of a little jar without it all coming out. it gets stuck in the grooves of the lid making it stick, and it ended up coating the inside of my little spice jar pretty thickly after only a month or so of being in there. garlic actually has naturally occurring sugars in it, and i think with it being so finely ground, just the humidity in the air makes it stick to everything; or just the fact that that i was trying to tap my little jar over cooking food (with steam) made a clumpy sticky messy jar. either way i never had this issue with other garlic in my years of cooking and i use lots of garlic. also, it clogged up the holes on my shaker in no time- so i was unsure of how to keep it handy and use it up. it makes a mess pretty easily, too, i found, because it is rather unwieldy, and one false move and POOF you will have a cloud of garlic dust to contend with that quickly gets sticky and messy. and although inhaling it may do wonders for a sinus cold- it is not a pleasurable experience!i do like that it is quite pungent and had a great garlic flavor. i strongly prefer organic, although it is from china so i kinda wonder about the authenticity of that. not that i have any evidence to support that in china they have not followed the organic regulations they are certified to uphold. that is just my perception- i would rather it came from north america.unfortunately, it is so finely ground that is is difficult to use and doesn't suit most dishes that i make. it is good in something that you will dissolve it in, but i like to sprinkle garlic on a lot of things and this just does not &#34;sprinkle&#34;. especially when you are cooking and there is steam coming out of a dish.i had decent luck mixing it with other spices in different spice mixes that i make. but it is definitely ground much finer than the other spices in the mix.all in all, i will not buy this again and will definitely make sure to get granulated garlic in the future. but if you want a strong, kick in the pants garlic flavor and don't mind garlic &#34;dust&#34;, then this is a good deal. otherwise, i would recommend granulated garlic. since i can't get organic from america, i am going to try (conventional) california garlic next.",3,"good flavor but too finely ground",1397347200,"2015-03-16"

"B001VNGMDE","You do have to use more of it to achieve a good garlic taste.  But then again, I am a garlic aholic and other than mincing or pressing real garlic, I have to increase the amount in the recipes.  It is good.

It actually makes me nervous to even use it.  We have no allergy to garlic.. it has been a major commodity in my kitchen for years and I have used a Frontier brand of garlic powder that was wonderful.  I thought this was the same thing, but the first thing I noticed was the powder is ground so fine that it just clumps together.  I can't use it in a shaker as I did my other powder.

I had just never seen garlic powder like this before and can't imagine why anyone would want it. One false move and you've got yourself quite a mess in the kitchen (and we've ended up inhaling more garlic than is probably healthy). If you put this in a shaker, take care to keep it away from any kind of steam, as it quickly turns into a solid mess and plugs up the holes in the shaker.Needless to say, we will not be buying this particular product again. The brand I think I would give another shot--there is no mistaking the strong, clean garlic taste--but for garlic look for the granulated version.",2,"Should be called garlic dust.",1371254400,"2015-03-16"

I did some research on these special New Mexico peanuts: There's Coenzyme Q10 in these peanuts - they're loaded with Coenzyme Q10. You should be getting a good dose of this stuff everyday but you can research that on your own...

"B002DHOVPS","Corn Pops, which used to be called 'Sugar Pops' before the health craze took over, are great. They are one of the few cereals that can be eaten with milk or without for breakfast...or just as a dessert snack at any time.Ah, but that's the rub.  You can very easily open the bag and start eating it by the handful.  It's not quite as good as the Cracker Jacks treats from which it might've been inspired, but it is excellent--tasting.  As to nutrition, there are many cereals out there that claim to be, and no doubt are, much better.  It is not particularly fiber-full, nor does it pack a lot of vitamins.Again, if you eat this cereal in moderation, with milk, as part of a 'healthy breakfast', it's great.  If you open the bag in front of the playoff games or the PC, it's even better, but your diet goes out the window.  It's your call...",4,"Sugar Pops are tops.",1352937600,"2010-06-25"

"B002DHOVPS","If you read the label on Kellogg's Corn Pops, you will see that it contains corn, sugar, soy & cottonseed. According to the information Kellogg gave me when I called, they are using genetically modified corn, soy, sugar from sugar beet and cottonseed oil. These GMOs have not been tested long enough to prove they are safe and the first long term, independent, peer reviewed study on the GMO corn found it is linked to mammary tumors, organ damage and premature death in lab rats. Kellogg's refuses to label these GMOs because they don't want you to know. The stuff is sprayed with RoundUP and the corn & cottonseed are actually EPA Registered pesticides. My family thinks Corn Pops taste like chemicals and it is not surprising when you know what the ingredients are. Kellogg's Corn Pops gave us stomach problems.

"B002DHOVPS","It seems like these are still a well-loved cereal, but there is a DEFINITE change in this over the years.  I noticed it the last time I had a box a few years ago, but decided to try them again.  I think they changed the formula in some way.  They are a little harder now, many in the box are a bit flattened, and there aren't any nice big puffs that the boxes used to have.  More importantly than that, the taste is different.  Instead of just the nice, lightly sweet flavor, there is now a strange aftertaste.  Probably chemicals, because that is what is in most processed foods.  Corn Pops never had that aftertaste more than 5 or 10 years ago.  So sad how even cereals have changed over the past decade and are becoming inedible.I'm downgrading this review to 1 star.  Not even a half hour after eating a bowl from my new box, I am getting heartburn from it.  I never got heartburn from cereal in the '80s, '90s, and even the early 2000s.  I grew up eating it most of my life.  I think the soy oils that are being added now are doing it.  Or the GMO soy and corn that everyone is talking about.  Something is NOT right.  Will never waste money on this again.And I agree with the other review that states Kellogg's is deceiving the public.

"B002HTOCRE","Once again I have the joy of reviewing yet another delicious Amy's product. I'd purchased this through my local supermarket, curious as to how the spinach aspect would work in this dish. (Spinach products can either be very good or very bad.)Taste-wise, this is amazing. Everything works very well together for this dish. While microwave food will never replace meals that are freshly made in your kitchen, this is incredibly tasty. (I believe it's because Amy's uses mostly organic food in its dishes.) I especially enjoyed the rice. Amy's manages to have microwave rice that isn't completely bland & inedible.Calorie & sodium-wise, this is a decent dish. At 39% of your daily intake it's still a little high but not nearly as much as the average enchilada microwave meal would. This meal has 390 calories, making it a decent fit diet-wise.Vegetarians will love this dish, but vegans won't. This does have cheese in it so if you have a milk allergy (like me) or if you are avoiding dairy for any reason, you'll want to avoid this dish.

She's now 2 1/2 and i have to say that its gotten to the point that I have to regulate how many of these she can have!I keep a box in the car along with an emergency diaper and wipes for those times when you just can't get home fast enough.

It seems like a lot of the squeeze packs are just fruit juice with a little bit of substance to thicken it. I love that this is a snack that is more balanced (it has protein and fiber from the Chia seeds and iron from the spinach) so it stays with the baby for longer.

Although if you want to use a spoon, the travel spoon tip that boon makes for plum organics fits the cap on these also.  These are a little expensive for everyday, but when we are going out I love that I can just throw a couple of them into the diaper bag.

I purchased a box of these hoping that he'd like the taste of the mango enough to mask the other fruits. He'd been getting constipated and I knew he needed more fiber, not to mention vitamin C. Well, he loves these. He loves the taste and he loves that he can feed himself (which is extremely important for a small guy like him with so many developmental delays).

"B0030VBPN2","The price was right (I won't pay more than $1/pouch unless it's an emergency ie screaming toddler while walking around the grocery store and I find myself out of emergency food) but I do wish these pouches would have more veggies. I've noticed that the flavor name (in this case &#34;Spinach, Mango and Pear) always lists the vegetable component first but the ingredients list names the fruits before vegetables. If you know how ingredients labels work, manufacturers are required to list in the order of greatest quantity first, (so the first item listed is present in greatest quantity, the second item listed is the next greatest quantity, etc - sorry if you already know this). It's annoying that manufacturers try and pull one over on the consumer by calling something &#34;Spinach, Mango, and Pear&#34; when it would be more accurate to call it &#34;Pear, Mango and Spinach,&#34; according to the ingredients. I typically try to stick to only pouches that have vegetable combos (Earth's Best has the most variety of just vegetable combos from what I've found), since my son has NO problem eating his fruits. He loves vegetables too but I'd prefer a snack of vegetables over fruits if I had a choice. The price is decent (go to Big Lots for much better deals, but of course the product is typically within 2-3 months of expiring), and product seems palatable.

I love that this flavor has beets as they are one of the healthiest foods you can eat.

My kid just sucks the food right out of these like sucking a bottle and he's happily fed in seconds.  Found these by chance when my kid was having a meltdown in the shopping cart at the grocery store.  Fed him right in the cart in under a minute and then we were on our way to finish the shopping trip in peace.  Fast, no messy bowls or utensils to carry around, and my kid loves them!  I've been hooked ever since and don't leave the house without them.  They are great while on long car trips or just running errands around town.  These are little pouches of sanity for any mom that's out and about with her baby.  I love the convenience and my kid loves the taste.  We've been using them for 3 months now, and my kid (now 12 mo) has since refused to eat jarred baby food, but will still suck these down without any complaints.

"B0030VBPN2","We have been a subscribe and save customer of this product for some time now, but on the last delivery I noticed that the packaging had changed. Upon further review, I noticed that the percentages of vitamins in the pouches had drastically decreased. I attribute this to a change in formulation of the ingredients. I am ok with changing your product, but you should let your customers know especially if they are on an automatic shipment program. This appears deceptive from my eyes due to the fact that the price of the product did not decrease when the value of the product did, to the best of my knowledge. The kids still really like the taste, but the nutrition of the product has been greatly diminished.We will cancel our subscribe and save for this product.

I love the fact that HappyFamily adds organic vegetables to their food, and not just fruit, like other companies. Also, I love how they add the super grain SALBA (from the white chia seed) to some of their foods. This is a great way to give my kids the protein, fiber, and omega 3's they need.

I appreciate that there are vegetables (sweet potato & carrot) in these while he loves the taste of the apple. I especially like the twist of adding cinnamon, probably why it's one of his favorites. He now knows how to squeeze every last drop out of these and often asks for more. They're also great for putting in his pack for school for an optional snack (because not all schools can afford 100% organic foods). Not to mention they have BPA free packaging and no GMOs.

The pouches make him happy -- he can feed himself, it's not as messy, and I can throw one in my bag for travel.Now that my son is a bit older, he feeds himself solids.  However, we still use the pouches when we are on the go.  The pouches are good for when he gets fussy and for when it's difficult to give him finger food (like when he's sitting in a shopping cart).

"B0030VBPN2","My children (almost 3 & 1-1/2) love squeezable fruit & veggie pouches.  This product is a great way to sneak in veggies for picky eaters and a great way to have variety and meet your daily values when out and about; I also find them to be a great snack. However, it is very difficult to find pouches with veggies at the local stores; mostly fruit pouches are sold, not many organic ones.  So I went to Amazon.  While I was happy to find Happy Tots by Happy baby (one of my favorite brands) the price was not that great.  I later found it for substantially less ($2 less) at a local organic market.  As to taste, while i've tried all other flavors and levels/stages, I will say that there is a particular taste to the Happy Tots because of the addition of a particular grain (Salba).

"B0030VBPN2","My toddler (nearly 2 now) has been enjoying Happy Baby's foods since his first Puffs at 7 months of age. While he's not in the baby food stage anymore, I keep these squeezable pouches around for quick snacks and on-the-go eating. I can't really think of a single bad thing to say about these pouches. They're organic. They're all-natural, without any additives, salt, sugar, etc. They're incredibly convenient to throw into my diaper bag to have handy whenever my little guy's looking for a snack, or to add on to a meal that's not as nutritionally-balanced as I'd like. They encourage independent eating - by this age, he slurps them up entirely on his own (once I twist off the cap, of course). They're a great way to get a little extra veggie content into his daily diet, especially on days when he's not in the mood for the vegetables on his plate at mealtimes. The ""super grain"" blended in makes this one a particularly healthy snack, with a little protein added to the fruit/veggie combination.The butternut squash/apple flavor was an instant hit, sweet and yummy.

HOWEVER, with this product and the other happybaby flavor i purchase (green beans, pears, and peas) i don't like how it appears on the front that the veggies are a predominant ingredient. the ingredient list on the back (and the color of the food itself) tells you that there isn't as much vegetable in there as there is pear. for something with spinach you would think the color would be closer to a green rather than just pear/mango. i've made tons of baby food at home and anything with a good amount of spinach (since they place it first and list it first on the FRONT, but the ingredients show otherwise) turns green! i suppose they keep it to a small amount to avoid deterring kids by the color.in the end, if he's getting organic pear with a side of organic veggies and a dose of omega 3s, it's better than goldfish crackers any day!",4,"both kids love it!",1314057600,"2010-01-13"

She can sometimes eat a whole container at one sitting!In addition to it being organic and having interesting flavor combinations (without getting too bold with the spices, which can turn our daughter off), I like that the food contains salba seed. According to my research, salba is fibrous and absorbs water, so it helps with digestion. If your child tends toward constipation, as ours sometimes does, this can really help move things along without being harsh. I also like the combinations of fruit and veg used in these pouches, which keeps the food from being overly sweet yet makes some of the trickier vegs more appealing.We have tried four different kinds of the Happy Tot pouches and all of them, even the one with peas in it, have passed the test.

"B0030VBPN2","I don't review products very often, but I wanted to comment on this product: it's not a fruit and veggie pouch, it's a fruit, veggie and grain pouch. It contains ""Salba, a super grain."" I don't really have a problem with it, except that my kids get plenty of grains from other sources, and I bought this because it was labeled a ""fruit and veggie pouch."" My kids don't really seem to like this flavor, and I tasted it and the grain is very... grainy. I don't know how to describe it other than it's a little like grits, or quinoa - very small, grainy bits in what I was expecting to be a smooth fruit and veggie puree. I'm sure it's healthy, but I wouldn't have ordered this particular flavor if the packaging had been clear about what was inside... which I feel like it wasn't. I usually order Plum Organics, and I've never felt mislead about what was in their pouches (they have grains, yogurt, etc. - or just fruit and veggie pouches, which is what I usually order.) I think I'll go back to that brand, as I'm not sure my kids will get through the box of this flavor that I ordered. (They didn't even finish the first pouch that I gave them, which is a first for them.)",2,"Fruit, Veggie and GRAINS",1356912000,"2010-01-13"
"B0030VBPN2","This is for HappyBaby Happy Tot fruit pouches. These are excellent for kids. My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it. [...]Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website. [...] Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S; on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. [...]. In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected.",5,"Great for kids, perfect for travel, what's not to like?",1339027200,"2010-01-13"
"B0030VBPN2","Like others have said, the consistency of this stage 2 combo is very thin, but it could be thickened with oatmeal or cereal. My 7 mth old loved the flavor and impatiently waited for more, which she doesn't do with all baby foods. I like that it contains spinach for iron and fruit for antioxidants and to sweeten it a bit. I wouldn't use these everyday while I'm home because they are somewhat costly per pouch, but they are a terrific option for travel or when you need something easy on hand to feed baby. I tried squeezing the contents of the pouch into her mouth, which she didn't particularly like, but I think that's just because she's used to being fed with a spoon. An older baby could squeeze and eat this themselves and if you find yourself without a spoon, it's a great option.",4,"Baby loved it, convenient pouch",1330992000,"2010-01-13"
"B0030VBPN2","My son (now 30 months), still loves these veggie pouches; he's been sucking the food out fo them rather than me using a spoon since he was about 16 months.

My little guy eats at least three ""nozzle"" foods daily and they are so convenient, I can stash them anywhere and not worry about them getting crushed or going bad.  We get the HappyTot ones because of the Salba grains added and the omega-3s in that.  They are wonderful.

"B0030VBPN2","I have a confession to make: I eat baby food. I'm not a kid, and I'm not even a mother, so I can't make the excuse that I'm testing it to make sure it tastes okay for my baby. I'm a college student with no kids. It's just so easy! And baby food and dog food are so much healthier than adult human food most of the time (no, I don't eat dog food too!).These are the things I like about this particular item. It's super convenient with its little pouch that you can carry with you wherever you go and drink out of. It's mess-free. It's extremely healthy, with fruits, veggies, and chia seeds. It's also fairly low in sugar compared to a similar product I have also tried, the Peter Rabbit Organics pouches (11g compared to 12-23g). Plus it's cheaper.The only things I don't like about this product are the taste and texture, but if your baby doesn't know better, (s)he might not mind. The Peter Rabbit Organics brand has a better taste, although with twice the sugar in some varieties, it's not hard to imagine why. The texture of the chia seeds is also annoying, but I put up with it because a) I already paid for it and b) they have Omega 3s, which are very good for you.With subscribe & save, I paid about a dollar per pouch, which isn't too bad. It's not too filling for an adult, but when paired with a mini Clif bar, it makes a healthy snack for less than the Fillet O Fish I would otherwise get at McDonald's.",5,"Very convenient",1317772800,"2010-01-13"

My kids are 2 yo boy and 8 yo girl and both of them love this flavor as well as the mango & spinach pouches.

Then, I went to the website, and that says that both packages are wrong! It says 2 grams of protein! And, it's not just the protein that differs on each label, the calories, sodium, fiber, and especially the potassium are completely different. How can I trust this product or this company?? If you have any of their products, take a look at the label on the box and compare it to the pouch itself. I won't be buying any more of their food.

Not to mention it's all organic. This particular one is a favorite of ours because of the cinnamon. Philip loves the taste of cinnamon. As a first time mom, it's great to know that I have an option out there for a tasty snack to give my son that is super healthy for him. Not to mention this on-the-go type pouch is really convenient.

There is also the bonus convenience factor since our stores were constantly running out of this brand.This flavor is the most nutritious. The pale green pouch comes second, but this combination really has by far the most nutrients than all the other flavors.

I am pleased with the product and the price, which saved money through the Subscribe and Save program Amazon offers.  I especially like HappyTot because its organic, and the different combinations of fruit/veggies has proved to be appealing to my child.  In addition to this, the addition of salba seed offers some fiber and extra nutrition.  I feel good that I can trust the contents of what I am giving my little one.

"B0030VBPN2","Happy Family Organic Superfoods got me very excited when I first discovered them. But since I'm the kind who will always look at the nutrition labels.....boy, was I disappointed at what I discovered!I didn't think the Happy Family products were ""enlightened nutrition"" as they call it! All I found was food that are Organic, etc. but still mostly SUGAR!I'm a little appalled at how good marketing can deceive us into calling ""healthy"" what may not be truly so. I looked indivually at most of their products (yoghurts, smoothies, pureed foods, snacks, bars, meals, etc.) and was very surprised to notice that almost all their food products (except the rare exception) are majorly SUGAR, Sugar and more Sugar for kids!Granted their product are USDA organic, contain super-foods & fruits (one source of the sugar I complain about), etc. and do supply the essential MICRO-nutrients (i.e. vitamins and minerals) BUT there is NO MACRO-NUTRIENTS BALANCE (i.e. Carbs vs. Fat vs. Protein). And of course, these products are still PROCESSED (i.e. NOT fresh); and moreover, contain substances to add texture, freshness, taste (that I consider undesirable) like Pectin, Corn Starch, Tocopherols, etc. The jury is out on many of these substances and I'd rather that none of these add-ons are in my kids food.When the majority of your product is going to only feed a kid SUGAR CALORIES and not Fibrous Carbohydrate calories or Other essential Macro-Nurtients like Proteins and Good Fats that are very, very essential for a child's growth.....you are not truly an ""Enlightened Nutrition"" company.If I was feeding my kid only their products in the belief I was feeding them only organic, my kid would severly lack in nutrition. Not to mention, be loaded on sugar & jump around like a squirrel.My conclusion: Given the sugar content, just because it is organic, it isn't all that different from a sugary drink.The nutrition label for this product is up. Check it out for yourself!Consider these other examples from their range - Happy Tot Plus (kale, apple, mango) is 100% carbs, 0% protein, 0% fat. 80% of the 100% carb is SUGAR! Hmmmm. Happy Puffs product? Again, 100% carbs. 0 protein, 0 fat. Hmmmm. You'd think at least their greek yoghurt products would have more protein? Guess what - Happy Baby Greek Yoghurt (strawberry, apple, beet) is 71% Sugar, 9% protein overall. Would I consider this healthy and complete nutrition for my kid? NO. Feeding this is yet again going down the path of getting my kid accustomed to flavor and sugar explosions, where getting them to enjoy fresh fruits and veggies will keep getting harder and harder. And naturally occuring tastes or a simple home cooked meal will find it hard to compete! Which to me then, is the inherent contradiction / conflict of interest in what this Organic Superfood company claims it s trying to do. To me organic doesn't stop at how something was grown or sourced. To me Organic is also equal to Simplicity.....of (i). Overall Process (until something reaches the mouth) AND (ii). Taste.Disappointed that even a team of professional pediatrians & nutritionists (who they claim they team up with) would approve of such a food range. If Sugar is most of what they sell, I'd rather not buy much from them. I really DO NOT WANT MY KIDS TO GROW UP EATING SUCH FOODS/RECIPES.The more I reaseach and inform myself, the more I'm convinced to stay away from processed and store bought foods.  This may be a slightly better option than a lot of other things out there, but it still leaves me wanting for so much more for my kids....especially if I'm going to pay that much more for buying organic.",1,"Lacks true nutrition!

The night before a busy day, I will throw these into the freezer and grab a few before leaving the house. By the afternoon, the pouches are still really cold and the perfect treat to cool down and the perfect replacement for non-nutritious ice cream or something along those lines. The added veggies are a huge plus too! I feel confident that I am giving my child a wonderful snack filled with fruits and veggies that she normally wouldn't eat by herself.

"B0030VBPN2","At home, I typically like to prepare my own food for my kids, with fresh fruit and vegetable smoothies. But I found it difficult to find healthy snacks for my kids while on the go or while traveling so I purchased these Happy Tot Spinach, Mango and Pear pouches. I like that they have both fruit and leafy greens in this fruit pouch. My kids enjoy the taste and receive them as a special treat and when we are on the go. In fact, my kids enjoy them so much that they never last long as they often request two of them at one sitting. I actually tasted them myself and they have a pleasant light pear flavor and I can just ever so slightly taste the spinach. Aside from the flavor, it is convenient that these pouches fit nicely in my diaper bag and I have never had them leak despite being buried under the constantly shuffled contents of my diaper bag.The reason that I am not giving these pouches five stars is that one pouch contains 11 grams of sugar. I wish that they could cut the sugar a bit, especially because my kids often want more than one pouch at each sitting. Still, the pouch is filled with vitamin packed mango, pears and spinach and one pouch provides a full day's recommended amount of Vitamin A and Vitamin C. So, though I would not recommend them as the exclusive means of providing your baby's fruit and veggie servings simply because I prefer to serve whole unprocessed foods when possible, I would definitely recommend them as a healthy snack for on the go and for occasional use at home when fresh fruits and veggies aren't available.",4,"Nice healthy snack for on the go",1364860800,"2010-01-13"

"B0030VBPN2","We are big fans of Happy Baby.We buy these both as food for our 9 month old baby as well as snacks for our 2 year old. Our 2 year old calls them &#34;fruit pouches&#34; and thinks they are delicious. Mom and Dad are happy to give them to her as they are simply pureed fruits and veggies--no added sugars and no junk. She eats these for snacks instead of crackers, cookies, etc, and gets some extra fruits and veggies in her diet in the process (without her knowing it!).We have tried many brands of these pureed pouches, and Happy Baby are our favorite. My daughter has loved every variety we've tried, and we've found that this brand is less expensive than others (ie Plum or Ella's Kitchen as well as the brands marketed specifically for toddlers).While these look like &#34;baby food&#34; they work great for toddler snacks too! Both our 9 month old and 2 year old have loved every variety we've tried, including those containing peas, broccoli, and spinach. You'll find that the veggie is listed last on the ingredient list in these (apple or pear is usually the first ingredient) but that's ok with me. My kids typically won't eat their veggies alone, so if I can get them to eat a smaller amount diluted out with fruit (compared to no veggies at all), I'm ok with that.",5,"Love Happy Baby!",1371168000,"2010-01-13"

"B0030VBPN2","I love this baby pouch.  I feel like some of the baby food flavors aren't very creative.  I love to cook and plan on having my kids eat what I make for them each night instead of cooking them their own 'dinners'.  Having unique flavor combo's like Banana, Peach and Mango, helps my baby to develop his taste buds.  You don't see Mango everyday in baby foods.  I use it all the time in smoothies and as snacks for my toddler.  Sometimes I don't have the time to cut up fruit, sit him in the highchair and then clean up the inevitable mess that follows.  Giving him one of these pouches, I know he is getting all the goodness of organic fruits and veggies.  We kept them in our freezer this summer and used them as a treat in the afternoons.  Just let it defrost for about 10-15 minutes and it becomes easier to get out of the pouch, but is still icy and cold.",5,"Love The Flavor Combo",1345939200,"2010-01-13"

I read the reviews and the majority of them were mom's talking about their babies and kids...but, what they don't know is that this is an excellent travel snack for anyone who works out. This flavor (banana, peach, prune and coconut) is perfect for potassium and iron as well as the hydrating factors of the coconut and energy from the chia seeds.  It is the perfect snack that packs light and is light in calories for me to take on my Mt. Biking trips.  I only wish there was a way to recycle the packaging.I strongly recommend this product!

These are absolutely perfect for travel, but more than that they are nutritious and I feel great about feeding them to my baby because of the quality. Sometimes I think these are better than the meals I end up making him. A bonus for mom, I downed an entire spinach/mango pouch once having forgot to bring my own lunch and it was very satisfying- just think of it like an extra thick Kerns nectar that actually tastes good.

"B0030VBPN2","i really liked these products , but you have to be careful , they are loaded with fruit sugars, 13 grams here, and the baby should have no more than 50 per day;. all sugar counts, and fruit sugars as sweetners are high, i am not buying this brand any more",3,"too much sugar",1372982400,"2010-01-13"
"B0030VBPN2","OK, That's probably an exaggeration, but let's do the math, and please correct me if I am wrong:The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides estimated energy requirements for infants based on the Institute of Medicine&#8217;s Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Based on these estimates, the average 10-month-old boy needs at least 793 calories, and 10-month-old girl requires 717 calories per day (Page 15).Fat: 1 gram = 9 caloriesProtein: 1 gram = 4 caloriesCarbohydrates: 1 gram = 4 caloriesThe 14 grams of sugar in this package provides 56 calories. 14 calories from fat and 4 calories from protein. Another 24 calories from the other 6 grams of carbohydrates. That is 98 calories. The package says 90, so that's about right.The World Health Organization just halved its recommendation from 10% to 5% calories from sugar per day. That's added sugar, but juice counts as added sugar, so this baby food is effectively the same thing. So one package of this stuff, and you've got your daily limit already.What about fats and protein? They need about 10 grams of protein. You'd need 10 packs of these, which would provide 10 times the daily level of sugar.And forget about those essential fats needed for healthy brain development. You might just do better with Chocolate truffles! At least they have fats to go with the sugar.By the way, once you feed your baby these sweet packages, forget about developing a good sense of taste for non-sugary things. Think of this baby food as training for the sugar cereals the industrial giants will push to your kids next.",1,"Bought this at Whole Foods - Same place I buy chocolate truffles, which are probably more nutritious!",1394928000,"2010-01-13"
"B0030VBPN2","What a great way to get some good nutrients in a baby food. And, in these packages, I cannot tell you how CONVENIENT they are. My daughter likes to eat it right out of the pouch. It is perfect for when we're traveling, or out at the mall or whatever. I can just twist off the top and feed her right there. These were a good price when I got them too!

"B0030VBPN2","I keep various organic fruit and veggie (and/or grain) pouches in the pantry.  If the kids finish their dinner and want a little extra food, they can go pick their own dry snack (e.g. plain crackers, veggie chips, pretzels) or pouch.  If we're heading out for something and I need to pack a snack, it's often easier to bring pouches than to bring cut up vegetables and fruits.  And my preschool aged son gets some kind of pouch in his lunchbox at least once a week.  I started out by wanting to sneak veggies in that my kids weren't jumping at the chance to eat, but now they love their veggies and I use pouches for the convenience.  I especially like them for road trips and vacations.",5,"Healthy and handy...",1402876800,"2010-01-13"

"B0030VBPN2","I'm a new convert to pre-packaged baby food. I typically make all my son's food but even with glass jars with lids its a little messy to tote my homemade stuff when we are out and about. I saw these at Target one day and decided to try them. I LOVE this stuff now :) I love the fact that it's all natural and the packaging is free of any of the gooky stuff I don't want to put in my kid. When we are out, I don't even take a spoon. My son just sucks it straight out of the package. He is breast fed and occasionally bottle fed and he had no trouble figuring out how to suck these out of the package right away.The flavors I've seen are all mostly fruits with some veggies snuck in. This one tastes mostly like apples (yes, I did taste it :) I taste all my son's food). I would like to see some more flavors that also taste of veggies so they don't get too stuck on the sweet stuff.I also like the fact that if he doesn't finish all of this in one sitting, I can put the cap back on and save it for later. One negative is that on some of the packages I found that the first little bit that comes out is a little nasty looking. The rest of the package looks good and my son has not had a negative reaction. I usually just squeeze that bit out first and let him eat it from there.The price here on amazon is the best I've seen. With subscribe and save I'm averaging $1 or less per package compared to in stores where they average about $1.50 per package.I would recommend this to anyone, whether you make your own food for your baby or consistently purchase baby food.

"B0030VBPN2","My son is 16 months and, while he is a balanced and good eater, I still feel he needs more vegetables during the day.  I try to send portions of canned veggies to day care (which, sadly, are his favorite -- I think it's because they're soft and he only has 5 teeth -- I buy the ""no salt added ones""), but I don't think they really worry about whether he eats the veggies as long as he eats SOMETHING.  WELL, with these pouches I don't have to worry as much that he isn't getting the nutrients and exposure to the flavor of the veggies.  He will drain these pouches in a second and then keep handing it back to me to so I can squeeze it to get the last drops to come out.  Sadly for him, he can already get the last drop out on his own so I have to tell him it's all gone.And, just in case you're worried they are mostly fruit, you're probably right.  Pear is listed as the first ingredient with peas and green beans listed after.  But, I did taste this one and it tastes exactly like pear sauce and pea puree mixed togehter.  It was pretty sweet, but so are actual peas. I was impressed that the pear flavor didn't completely mask the pea flavor, so he is still developing a taste for vegetables, not just fruit.  Bottom line -- he loves these and it is better than no veggies at all!I give it a 4 only because they are (too) pricey.  I get that they are organic, so maybe they have to be that expensive, and it's expensive packaing, but $1.50 per pouch is a bit much.  You can buy pouches like this from Motts and other companies (in boxes of 4) that are just apple sauce or apple/strawberry sauce for much, much cheaper.  Likewise, Beechnut makes some with sweet potato and pumpkin that are $.99.  The thing is, none of those products include any GREEN veggies, which is why I shell out the $ for these.  I suggest buying in bulk because it will save you a little $ and you're going to want to have one for every day.",4,"Great for toddlers! They are yummy, but don't completely mask the veggie flavor",1330300800,"2010-01-13"
"B0030VBPN2","Love this product. Perfect for babies while on the go. We actually purchased these specifically while on vacation (usually I just have a few on hand for occassional use).

I find myself filling with with individual ones of a different flavor here and there cause I can tell my daughter gets tired of it.Although, along with a previous review, I too, received the 3.5 ounce package rather than the size stated in the description. BUT, Amazon has amazing customer service and immediately fixed the problem.

I actually just received other orders of the baby food today, which were packaged as I've seen them before (2 packages of 8). Not sure why this one is listed as a pack of 16 when it's only 8.

It's a nice way to get her to eat spinach.  And I'd rather have her snacking on these squeeze foods than on junk food.

We just pop off the cap and he eats straight out of the pouch.  I also love that they've added the supergrain so that the kiddo gets a dose of omega-3s.  If you compare the nutritional information on the back of the product with other organic fruit-pouch brands, you'll see that HappyTot pouches and the other HappyBaby brand pouches actually have nutritional value in them.  Some of the others (I'm looking at you, Revolution Mashups) hardly have any nutritional value at all--not even vitamin C in some flavors.  I gotta say that my son loves all of the HappyTot fruit-veggie combos, though my palate not so much.

Their answer ""Unfortunately, there has been an error on our packaging which left the lemon juice concentrate off of the ingredients panel on a few pouch production runs, our sincere apologies. It is possible that the small amount of lemon juice in the pouch is not enough to bother your son's allergies, as only a drop is needed to lower the pH.

"B0030VBQGS","I love this brand, especially these pouches. They're organic without a bunch of preservatives and I think they taste pretty great. The mango flavor is a great price,the pear seems overpriced on Amazon though. Just about every flavor I've had has tasted really good, the only one I'm not crazy about is apricot/sweet potato (not available in this particular listing). It's a little tangier than I would have expected, but my son still likes them. When you buy the 16 pack from Amazon they come in a box with perforated sides so you can rip off the top of the box at an angle. This gives you easy access but keeps them organized which is nice.One thing to keep in mind is that some (like Mango) contain abscorbic acid. It's naturally occurring and perfectly healthy as I understand it, but from what I've read it can damage teeth over period of time.

"B0030VBQGS","I bought a single pack of this first to try to see how this can possibly be called 'fresh mango' when it is sitting on a back shelf of a small corner grocery store in our area for i don't know how long. I opened it and tried it and unless we got a dud, real 'Fresh' mango when peeled cut into chunks and pureed will be a bright yellow or bright orange color, not a brownish color which is what this 'fresh' mango puree was. I am a real mango lover and personally feel this color and taste is what an over ripened mango that is going bad will look and taste like. After reading all the reviews i was disappointed, and my baby only had a teaspoon and didn't know any different since it was her first fruit. Also can you really classify something as 'fresh' when it can sit in it's packaging for a whole year? IMO the lure of this and similarly packaged products is basically the design of the packaging and the products easy accessability. As others say you can eat it on the go, while traveling and anywhere basically and the child can hold it, it doesn't create a mess, bpa free packaging easy all around. Other then that once opened it's only good for a day or 2 like a real fresh cut mango is anyway, only its not really 'fresh'..but since here on the northeast mangos only come around a few months out of the year and since most people don't have the time to puree their own fruits and veggies, these types of products are the only alternative, otherwise cubing and pureeing your own mango..now that's fresh mango! Hopefully i can find the time to start pureeing soon. Edit: tried another pouch and it wasn't brown it was more like a bright orange as a mango should be and it did taste good.

"B0030VBQGS","I started (like many parents) by purchasing Gerber & Beech Nut brands baby food from Walmart, as it was basically their only choice in our small town. I then searched online & found the Happy Baby Organic (as well as Earth Best, Plum Organics, Sprout, and a few other brands.) I loved the massive variety and the Organic factor! I quickly ordered a large variety from an Amazon sub-vendor (VitaCost) and started my son on the Gerber Organic Rice cereal while I waited for the others to come in. My son was okay with the cereal, but when I started him on the packaged Gerber foods, he hated them! He has hated every one of the Gerber package foods, and yet loved the same fruits and veggies from Happy Baby and Earth Best! I even tried giving him a Gerber, then a Happy Baby, then back to a Gerber just to make sure he just hadn't &#34;gotten used to it,&#34; but nope, he would grimace and spit out the Gerber and shriek and smile with the Happy Baby. The other thing I noticed, Gerber packages are &#34;light&#34; meaning they are not filled to the oz they claim to be, and the Happy Baby, Earth Best, Sprout & Plum Organics are &#34;heavy&#34; meaning they are filled to slightly over the oz they claim. Gerber packages were off by as much as a quarter ounce, so that adds up quickly. That being said, the Happy Baby (and other Organic ones we tried) are worth the extra price to get. Between the full packaging, organic ingredients, variety of flavors (and nutrients) and superior (all natural) tastes, you can't go wrong. My son absolutely loves the mixed carrots, squash, and sweet potatoes. In fact, he loves them more than the fruits! By exposing your little one to such a wide variety as is available, you are giving them great eating habits, nutrition, and lowering their allergy potential (according to our doctor) and increasing their willingness to have and try a wider variety of foods as they get older.

"B0030VBQGS","I bought two full cases of Happy Baby Mango pouches (32 total).  They are soooo watery in consistency.  I have purchased the butternut squash and they were just fine.  The Mango pouches are almost like drinking straight juice instead of pureed mango.  They were also slightly sour making me think that the mangoes used were less than ripe.  I will not be purchasing again nor can I recommend them.EDITED:  AFTER REVIEWING THIS ITEM, I SAW THE POST FROM HAPPY BABY AND CONTACTED THEM DIRECTLY.  THEY REPLACED THE ITEMS THAT I WAS UNHAPPY WITH.  SO EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT HUGE FANS OF THE MANGO POUCHES, THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AND MAKE SURE THE CUSTOMER IS HAPPY.

"B0030VBQGS","If you need the convenience of this kind of pouch packaging (lightweight, not breakable glass) for ""on the go"" situations, the Amazon price for these is the best anywhere.  Less than $1 per 3.5 oz pouch.  At the time I'm writing this review, the per ounce price is less than Plum Organics, Ella's Kitchen and Sprouts.  I also prefer this packaging over Sprouts because you don't need a spoon to feed baby, just squeeze directly in the mouth.However, if I'm feeding at home, the best bargain is withEarth's Best Organic 2nd Pears, (6 months & up), 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12).

I don't have a whole lot of time to make my own baby food, but using this helps me get him some more variety.  It's pretty thin, so I can use it to blend with either avocado or spinach+banana.

They are definitely convenient and weigh less than the jars and don't require spoons. If your baby doesn't eat all of it I feel like the cap doesn't really go back on securely so don't throw it in the bottom of your diaper bag (lesson learned). The other thing I don't recommend is handing one over to your kid in the backseat. Or anywhere else. Because at some point they take it out of their mouth and give it a squeeze just to see what will happen. The cap, this was pointed out to me, is also a choking hazard. All of that said they are organic, there aren't a bunch of extra ingredients, my son loves all the different flavors and combinations no matter how weird they sound to us (or how awful the taste), they are lightweight, and they look cool.

I'm trying to introduce him to all the fruits and vegetables that are OK for him to eat at this age, and I'm hoping that eating the spinach in this will make him less likely to reject it later...

The consistency looks like a berry smoothie and it smelled great.  So I tasted it and it does have a bit of a tart taste, but it's very slight to me.  I almost wanted to finish it because it had just enough sweetness to go with the slightly tart taste.  It's too bad this isn't made in the 4.2oz package because our daughter usually wants just a bit more than what comes in this package.It is a bit more expensive than some other organic brands, but well worth the price.  In our opinion, the flavors taste so much more natural and fresh and taste great to us as adults rather than having that ""baby food"" type of taste that many brands have.Also, there is aPlum Organics Dispensing Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)that can screw onto this packaging as well as the Plum Organics packages of food.  It comes with a carrying case for the spoon tips.  This makes feeding time so much easier when you screw the spoon onto the package and then can easily throw away the package and put the spoon tip back in the case rather than having to bring a separate spoon and container to squeeze the food into so you can feed your baby.",4,"Sweet and a little tart, but delicious and fresh!",1310083200,"2010-01-13"

Terribly bitter (just the thought makes my mouth water) and runny.  No wonder he wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't either!  I did buy some of the other varieties offered by HappyBaby and he loves them.

"B0030VBQOK","My 1 yro daughter adores all the flavors of pur&eacute;e packs. As soon as I open the cabinet they are in she grabs a pack or two and starts sucking on the tops hoping I will open it for her.  I use these mainly for when we are out of the house.  We travel a lot and these are great to have in our bag to make sure she gets something good and healthy to eat. These are also great for making sure your kid gets some good food during a long plane trip. You do not really even need a spoon with this as they can just suck all the savory goodness straight out of the pack. Just make sure they do not squeeze it all over themselves when they become over zealous in getting it out or just playing with the packet.  She loves the packs so much it then becomes a fun toy when it is empty.Since she loves the flavor of the packets so much I have also used them for bribery.  Sometimes she gets bored eating something, or it is not her favorite kind of food. However when I smother the food with the packet. She will go right back to eating it.  I use it as a kind of a baby condiment when I am trying to get her to eat those few extra bites.Pros: Easy to use. Great Taste. Easy to Pack. All organic.Cons: Be careful they do not squeeze the packet all over themselves. A bit on the sweet side (but that's why they love it so much.)",5,"Great food for on the go and as a condiment",1354838400,"2010-01-13"
"B0030VBQOK","Beets!!!  How many of you out there have babies/toddlers/kids who eat beets?  Well, mine aren't big fans but they LOVE these pouches.  This is a great combination with the blueberries and bananas and you can still taste the beets.  Anytime my 15 month-old twin boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their antioxidants and nutrients.It's especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage.  For the teethers, it's helpful to place a few pouches in the fridge.  For the picky eaters, it's helpful for us to administer a swig of this inbetween bites.  These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy.  If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food.  The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all.  Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later or if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack.  No yucky jar top taste, no spoons to mess around with, and the combinations are tasty.With the subscribe and save, it's so much more cost saving than purchasing these in the stores.",5,"Great, tasty nutrients in one easy to deliver pouch!",1293753600,"2010-01-13"
"B0030VBQOK","My 16-pack of the Spinach, Mango and Pear just arrived, and I have to say, I wish I had tried an individual packet before going for the whole box.While the flavor seems fine (though quite sweet), and I'm glad to see actual spinach in there, the puree is extremely runny. It's like soup! I have to add oatmeal to it to thicken it enough to stay on the spoon! That defeats the purpose of the pouches, in my opinion. I bought these so I could use the screw-on spoon with them while we were traveling. As is, the puree is too runny and messy to bring traveling. My 7-month old hasn't mastered drinking from a straw yet so she can't suck it down directly from the opening.

It is so convenient, too...because when we are out at the park or after a doctor's appointment and he's hungry, I can just take one of these out of the diaper bag and squeeze it into the spoon for him to eat it. Also, when he only has half of it, we put the rest in the fridge and then in the evening we heat it up in a bowl of hot water.

He'll also take one when he's &#34;starving&#34; and needs a bite to eat before dinner's ready.The consistency of this puree is thinner than your average applesauce, as it's intended to be easy-to-eat for babies who are new to purees. That's great news if you have a little one who's just starting out on solid foods. I've seen reviews from people with slightly older kids that complain about the thin texture. However, that doesn't bother my son any. The consistency is sort of along the lines of a smoothie, especially if the pouch has been chilled before he eats it.

"B0030VBQOK","My daughter eats these because there is a picture of a seal on the actual pouch. When we opened the box, the pouches were not the ones with the seal, they were the ones with only the sweet potato. We were disappointed because packaging is everything at this age, and our  pouches did not have seals on them. Our local super market does not carry the package with the seal, so we were excited to find them on amazon, only to find out, it wasn't actually what we wanted, even though the seal package is pictured on the website.",1,"The Packaging Design Was Not As Pictured",1374883200,"2010-01-13"

"B0030VBQOK","The individual packages are labeled as ""Net weight 3.5oz,"" but this is often false.  I weighed multiple samples with a precision digital scale.  The package itself weighs about 0.5oz, so the total weight of food and package should be 4oz.  This is frequently not the case.Out of a dozen samples, only one contained enough food to make a net weight of 3.5oz. Most weighed closer to 3oz net, and none were over 3.5oz net, which means that you're consistently getting less food than you paid for.",2,"Misleading packaging, inconsistent amounts",1359504000,"2010-01-13"

He is a fairly good eater of whatever we give him, but I don't think I've seen him this excited to eat since he first started on solids.  The problem is, I tasted a tiny bit of it and it was extremely sweet.  The package doesn't list any additional sugars or sweeteners, but I find it hard to believe that pears can be THAT sweet.  Even if the sugar comes 100% from the pears and is natural, I still think it's too much.  I'll be mixing it in with oatmeal until it's done and after that I will try a couple other brands to see if there is anything less sweet out there.

I would have never thought to combine apricots and sweet potatoes on my own, but the combination works! I love that it is really nutrient dense and an easy snack for on the go.

I'm sure she would have survived without veggies, but it still bothered me that she wasn't eating any.  (It's a mom thing I guess!)  I saw these in the store and thought that the combinations of fruits and veggies in these looked ""interesting.""  I picked up a few, not really expecting my little one to like them.  However, she really liked them - a lot.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they come in a pouch that she can feed to herself.Not only were these great to give her as an infant, she still enjoys these as a toddler.  These are great to take with on outings - when it's otherwise difficult to give her produce.  She can eat these without making a mess and we don't have to worry about spoilage.  So far, she has liked all of the flavors.  I like the fact that these aren't stored in plastic or in jars with BPA.

"B0030VBQOK","My daughter loves this (as well as every other Happy Baby food she has tried)! The only reason I docked a star is because the consistency is thin. I normally mix all of her Stage 2 foods with cereal, so it's not a big deal for us. However, if your baby eats this straight, try one of the various ""squeezie"" spoons on the market. It is too runny to use a traditional spoon.Update:I changed my rating to five stars. Yes, it's still a bit runny. However, I have found this to actually be a good thing.My daughter is almost seven months old. We were out the other day, and I had a pouch of this food in the diaper bag. I had just gotten her seated for lunch when I realized that I'd forgotten her bowl, spoon, and cereal to mix with the food. I decided to let her try to ""eat"" it directly from the pouch. (We both drink homemade green smoothies a lot. The consistency is similar.) It was great! She was easily able to suck it out of the pouch, with me holding the pouch, making sure that there was always food near the opening. She only spilled a tiny bit onto her bib. It also took less than five minutes for her to eat!I am going to keep a pouch of this food in the diaper bag from now on.

Like most households, our mornings are super crazy and these are so perfect to use on the go and in the car. Banana Kiwi is one of our favorites.

"B0030VBQOK","At first I was reluctant to purchase fruit pouches because I prefer to give my kids whole fruit and veggies. But after one too many smashed plums or bananas in the diaper bag, I decided to give these a try for a healthy on the go snack. These are great to have on hand and just throw in the diaper bag for a day out. I have never had them leak in my diaper bag or rip apart. My kids love the apricot and sweet potato flavor and they get excited when I get them out. I also give them to my kids at home if we run out of fresh fruit.The consistency of the fruit in the pouches is runny. I always make my baby put the pouch spout in their mouth before I let them hold it. I started doing this after learning the hard way when they would grab the open pouch and half of it would squirt all over me and them. I also like that it has a screw on cap so if they don't finish their pouch I just put the cap on and refrigerate it so that they can have it for another time. I will buy these again because they are a tasty and portable healthy snack.",5,"No more smashed fruit on the bottom of the diaper bag",1367452800,"2010-01-13"
"B0030VBQOK","My 9 month old started eating this flavor at about 7 months old and loves it!  She isn't really a picky eater, but she likes some things more than others.  When its time for the spinach/mango/pear she takes one tastes then asks for more!  I've tasted it, its pretty good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the consistency is a bit watery and difficult to keep on the spoon when feeding the baby.  I'd love it if they just didn't puree it quite as much or didn't add quite so much water, then it would be perfect.",4,"A must have for the diaper bag!",1308182400,"2010-01-13"

"B0030VBQOK","My 5-month old has enjoyed happybaby products in the past, so we thought we'd try out these mixes.  The pear-pea-broccoli packages had dried baby food on the outside.

He is eager to try, sometimes he even takes it out of the food storage box and asks me to open for him, but after one sip or two, he gives up. Now I am stuck with a box of these, not knowing what to do with it. I'd like to give them away, but if my son doesn't like them, how can I know if other babies will eat it? I will not buy them again. My mistake was that I didn't read all the reviews on this item :(. A hard lesson learned!",1,"Too sour, 16 months old doesn't like it at all. A waste of my money!!!",1309996800,"2010-01-13"
"B0030VBQOK","We are big fans of Happy Baby.We buy these both as food for our 9 month old baby as well as snacks for our 2 year old.  Our 2 year old calls them &#34;fruit pouches&#34; and thinks they are delicious.  Mom and Dad are happy to give them to her as they are simply pureed fruits and veggies--no added sugars and no junk.  She eats these for snacks instead of crackers, cookies, etc, and gets some extra fruits and veggies in her diet in the process (without her knowing it!).We have tried many brands of these pureed pouches, and Happy Baby are our favorite.  My daughter has loved every variety we've tried, and we've found that this brand is less expensive than others (ie Plum or Ella's Kitchen as well as the brands marketed specifically for toddlers).While these look like &#34;baby food&#34; they work great for toddler snacks too!  Both our 9 month old and 2 year old have loved every variety we've tried, including those containing peas, broccoli, and spinach.  You'll find that the veggie is listed last on the ingredient list in these (apple or pear is usually the first ingredient) but that's ok with me.  My kids typically won't eat their veggies alone, so if I can get them to eat a smaller amount diluted out with fruit (compared to no veggies at all), I'm ok with that.",5,"Love Happy Baby!",1371168000,"2010-01-13"

"B0030VBQOK","Since there is more fruit than veggies in these pouches, I like to mix in part of a pouch of vegetables when serving this. While the sweetness really isn't an issue for these fruit and veggie blends, I have found it helpful to mix it in with fruits or vegetables that the little one has disliked before, then the next time add more of the straight fruit or veg and less of the blend, and maybe once more repeat this with barely any of the blend. It's tempted him enough to keep giving the initially disliked fruit or vegetable a second chance, and by the third or fourth feeding when there's no more of the sweet blend like this mixed in, he usually is now gung-ho on a food he would only spit out before. This really worked with some of the more bitter/off-putting produce out there, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and spinach. I've sampled all of the foods I've given to my child to make sure something isn't too sweet or too sour, and even though there isn't much produce I don't like, some of the single item baby foods out there are great examples of why someone would never want to eat that particular item. I suppose by mixing some of the sweeter/tastier blends in with the unappetizing one, it's akin to people using butter, bacon, and/or cheese as grown-ups to make foods more palatable.And like another reviewer mentioned, any leftovers work great mixed into your dog's food (after verifying it won't cause any health problems for them). Our two senior dogs enjoy the additions, and they've had no tummy issues either. If you don't have dogs, you can also freeze any leftovers you won't use in the next 24 hours. I use an ice cube tray, empty the pouch into it, and use the cubes for my smoothies later on, or even as a frozen treat for our dogs. I've also added the leftovers into soups and sauces.",5,"Nice to know it is all natural",1401408000,"2010-01-13"

She has tried the other flavors, but she definitely prefers pear/apple mixes.  I prefer green veggies because they pack more of a nutritional punch.  These pouches don't replace her vegetable intake, but they are a great healthy addition to an already balanced diet.Some people don't like the high applesauce component of some baby food mixed pouches, but I find that Happy Baby lists a very short ingredient list that includes vegetables.

However, he happily ate entire pack of HappyBaby Spinach, Mango & Pear and asked for more two days in the row! My husband is a Mr. Mom for now so weight off his shoulders as far as feeding.

"B0036FB6FY","I decided to try quinoa after hearing about it from a nutritionist on TV.  I looked it up on Amazon as I couldn't find it in my grocery store.  Thanks to several posters, I ended up purchasing this brand at Costco.  As a newbie I can't compare it to other brands.  Not sure whether I liked it at first, but after a little experimentation, I am now enjoying it.  First try, it seemed a little bitter to me.  Not sure if that's the brand or the nature of quinoa.  Then I read a recommendation from other quinoa users advising a 30 minute soak of the grain before cooking it to minimize any bitter taste.  This did seem to help.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because although I am satisfied with the product and the brand, I'm not sure of how it compares to other brands and also because price is much higher than Costco.",4,"Newbie to quinoa",1307059200,"2013-04-26"

"B0036FB6FY","Four pounds of Quinoa is a lot of grain - if you can find it in a much smaller pkg I would advise getting that first to see if you like it. Quinoa has a wild taste, which reminds me of dandelion greens - smells like dandelion greens too. I will make use of the entire 4 lbs because it is good for you and has lots of protein. What I found to be the best way of eating it is to add spaghetti sauce - the tomato sauce seems to lessen the wild taste. I suppose one will get used to the taste after a while. The reason I bought it was for the gluten-free grain aspect, for people that have Celiac this grain will be very beneficial as a cereal or use it like you would rice. The cooking is fairly simple - one part quinoa to two parts water, bring to a boil and then cover and take off the heat. When the water has all be absorbed it is ready to eat. Also tastes good cold with cinnamon and sugar. Try to find a smaller pkg would be my advice.",4,"Quinoa Review",1359849600,"2013-04-26"

"B0036FB6FY","I've enjoyed quinoa before and found this product to be no exception.  It has arrived promptly both times I've ordered it.  It has not, for me, required washing.  My family has enjoyed it.Some details . . .I prepare in a steamer, as with rice.  I used 1 c. quinoa and 2 c. water in rice container, with 2 c. water in the steamer reservoir.  I expect steamers vary, so the reservoir amount may not work for you. Very easy to prepare, though.Another reviewer noted that quinoa may cause GI symptoms.  This may be true for folks who have never, or rarely, eaten quinoa. The same may happen with the introduction of other new foods into one's diet.  If this is a concern, one might start by adding it to soup, or in some other way reducing the concentration of quinoa in the meal. Not necessarily needed, but one way to address that possibility.  We did not have any problem.Both times, the bag arrived with a small puncture that allowed a small amount of the quinoa to leak into the packing box.  With the second shipment, I made a note to check the packing done for shipping and observe that it was well packed.  I don't know if the bag tends to be a bit fragile, but the breaks were quite small.  It was obviously not enough to keep me from purchasing a second time.Finally, I found that organic quinoa has been added at our local grocery recently, and the price seems a bit lower.  It might be worth comparing local prices before purchasing.",4,"Organic quinoa",1358294400,"2013-04-26"

"B0036FB6FY","Quinoa (Keen-Wa) is an &#34;Ancient Seed from South America, supposedly cultivated by the Mayans.  High in protein and low in carbs (Compared to other grains like Rice), I use it as a pasta substitute.  Cooking is easy, just 1 cup Quinoa and 2 cups liquid (water, broth, etc) will yield 3 cups cooked product.  Which is pretty impressive, while preparing it you need to season it a little, because with out it, it's a little bland.  The easiest way to prep it, I find anyways, is to use a rice cooker, (which I purchased from this site) if you really like this product I suggest investing in one.  As others have said this product does need to be rinsed before preparation, and normal colanders do not have small enough holes for the product, you might also want to look into a rice washing bowl (another Item I purchased from amazon).

I LOVE this product, and reorder when I'm getting low. It is a staple in my home. A hint...if you will not use the whole bag in 6 months or so, you may want to squeeze the air out of the bag and store it in the freezer, to prevent off tastes from forming.

"B0036FB6FY","This is a great grain. I have a moderate sensitivity to rice so i try to stay away from it as much as I can. So I have been using quinoa to replace it. It is a very mild tasting grain and can be made with different herbs and seasonings. I especially love it w/black beans, onions, cumin & cilantro. I also love it in soups. I made some chicken soup the other day and added quinoa and even froze it. Unlike rice that swells even more from freezing in soups, quinoa doesn't seem to keep absorbing the liquid so your soup doesn't get thick and mushy like with rice. It is also very healthy for you containing protein, vitamins and amino acids and is gluten free. And buying this 4 lb pkg was very economical.

"B0036FB6FY","Quinoa, pronounced ""keen-wah,"" is touted by many as a ""super food."" It seems as if it might be a whole grain, but it actually is a seed. It is grown  in the Andes Mountains of South America and is an ancient food highly prized by the Incas.Quinoa is very high in protein compared to grains, making it an excellent choice for vegetarians. It is also on the approved list for those on an alkaline diet as it is considered less acid than grains. Many people with gluten sensitivities substitute quinoa for wheat. When quinoa is rated on the glycemic index, it comes in at a very low 18, making it a great choice for people who are hypoglycemic, diabetic, or on a low-glycemic diet to lose weight.1 cup of cooked quinoa has this nutritional breakdown:222 calories, which is 70% carbs, 15% fat, and 15% protein in this manner:4 grams of (healthy) fat39 grams of carbohydrates (5 grams of which is fiber)8 grams of proteinQuinoa contains folate, which is an important B vitamin, magnesium, phosphorous, copper and manganese.Quinoa can be ground into flour (I use myVita-Mixto do that) and substituted for wheat flour in recipes for baked goods. The whole seed can be cooked just like rice. You use 2 cups of water per 1 cup of quinoa, bring it to a boil, and let it simmer about 15 minutes. When you see ring-shaped sprouts popping out of the quinoa seeds, it is almost finished. Stir it to make sure all the water is absorbed.Quinoa by itself tastes a bit bland, but that's actually an advantage in cooking as it can absorb the flavor of herbs and spices very well. It makes an excellent pilaf and a nice addition to a thick, hearty soup. You can also stir in blueberries or other fruit and eat it as a breakfast porridge.",5,"High protein, alkaline wheat substitute",1325721600,"2013-04-26"

This product is as good or the wame as the Eden Organic Quinoa, Whole Grain, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6) which I heard to be the best but I can not tell the difference between the two so my advice to you if your into Quinoa purchase the Earthly Delights from Costco.",5,"Great product replacement for rice.",1332115200,"2013-04-26"

At first when cooking this up, I went online to see how others did it, so I followed the directions and washed it, rinsed it and let it soak. I cooked it per instructions on the package. I could understand the bitterness, that did not bother me. What bothered me where really crunchy, rock-like things in this brand of quinoa (I've had quinoa cooked by friends and never had this problem). After about the third time I crunched onto something really hard, I had to fish the item out of my mouth and it appeared to be a chunk of glass???

"B0036FB6FY","Quinoa is expensive in the grocery store. I like it, but the cost is around $6+ per pound. The Nature's Earthly Choice was $4 per pound ($15.99 per 4lbs bag) and the quality is quite good. Nutritious, tasty, and easy to make, this is a great substitute for rice. Quinoa can be served in salads, as a side dish, and even as a main course. I have tried several new ideas out and all have been well received. Quinoa is a very flexible ingredient to work with. I recommend giving it a try. Other merchants are selling Quinoa in 10lbs bags that cannot be resealed. While the prices can be attractive, those big bags are very cumbersome to work with, especially after they are opened. These 4lbs resealable bags are a great size to work with.BTW - If the product was around $3 per pound, I would have given it 5 stars",4,"Good product at a decent price",1364601600,"2013-04-26"

BUT once I received the Quinoa, I had to try it out. This Quinoa product rocks! Excellent flavor. I prepared it in a rice cooker. I added the appropriate amount of water, some margarine, a pinch of salt, a couple of TBS white raisins, 1/2 diced apple, a couple of dashes cinnamon, and proceeded to cook it. It cycled just fine in the rice cooker. Now with a little Splenda, and some cream, I had a really nice breakfast/dessert dish. Quinoa has a very slight split pea flavor, and works well in virtually any dish as a rice substitute.

I hope Amazon keeps this available and Nature's Earthly Choice keeps providing it, as I will be buying quinoa for the rest of my life. I do wish they sold this item in greater quantity.

"B0036FB6FY","Quinoa (pronounced : KEEN-WA) is a great substitute for rice and pasta.  It is relatively easy to cook. Very similar to cooking rice but a little more practice to get it just right.  It is also easy to change the taste/ It has an wonderful aroma and taste slightly nutty.  To give it a more nutty taste just cook it without the water for a little less than a minute.  Also, instead of water substitute a vegetable, chicken or beef broth or stock.There are a few things to remember.  Make sure that you buy pre-wash quinoa otherwise you will have to rinse them.  If you do not rinse them they have a very bitter unpleasant taste. This brand is organic and pre-washed.  There are a few like this on the market and the ones I have tried are all good.  I will say that if the brands were all on the store shelf I would reach for this one.Using quinoa I have found that it does not drive my blood glucose levels up like rice or pasta.  In just about any dish that I would use rice or pasta this substitues well. It has a very pleasant taste once you know how to cook it.  If you can read you should be able to follow the simple directions on the bag.I make my own organic pasta sauce and use quinoas instead of pasta and find that I actually prefer quinoa especially since most wheat grown in the United States may be GMO.  If I do buy pasta I always buy a brand made in Italy since GMO is not permitted in Europe.  But, if it is organic it is not GMO and to my knowledge there is no GMO quinoas. Thjis brand, without doubt is not GMO.The bottom line is that quinoa taste good.  If one has a health issue such as gluten allergy or diabetic issues it may be wise to consider quinoa as a substitute for rice or pasta if your health care provider agrees.  It substitues well in most recipes and even has a few of its own.  The only caution I would have is to be sure they are pre-washed.",5,"A good replacement for rice or pasta",1367539200,"2013-04-26"

It has a slight sweetness to it, and doesn't have the saltiness of soy sauce.  I have been using it to saute veggies and have used it flavor steak.  I'm looking forward to my cheat day so I can try it with sushi.  It's more expensive than traditional soy sauce, so it's not ideal for marinading, but we've found a little goes a long way.

"B003XB5LMU","I have been buying this product for a few years, and I have to say it is a great soy sauce replacement.  I use it on rice, in making my own bourbon chicken, stir fry, and teriyaki sauce, and marinades.  There are many recipes online that work great with this as a replacement. The best thing is that the sodium level is no where near that of Soy sauce. I am gluten and soy free and this has helped me have the full flavor when eating oriental foods again. The only problem I have dealt with is not the product but the shipping.  Sometimes, because it is fermented, the box is shaken up during transit I guess, and when you open it the product has seeped out of the container all over everything, even though it is still sealed.  That has happened to me twice(but not with Amazon orders!).",5,"Great if you are allergic to Soy!",1360886400,"2011-08-12"

I have no problem paying more money on a product as long as it's a quality product.  I have no way of knowing whether this is indeed a quality product.  Future buyers be aware that there seems to be an issue with the product arriving with a broken seal (despite what looks like 'protective' packaging).  I recommend opening your package while holding it over the sink in case this happens to you.  Thankfully I opened mine in the kitchen but unfortunately, it was over the counter so, I ended up not only without a useable product but a nasty mess to clean up in my kitchen!

I generally think that shipping is a separate concern, but I'm not so sure after this purchase!  I purchased this product from D.M.E. ONLINE SALES INC (AKA Medical Supply Superstore), but it was shipped by Amazon.  When the package arrived, more than a quarter of it had leaked through both the padded manilla envelope and the box it was shipped in, staining the other item in the box (gloves), as well as the outside of the box that was delivered.  I contacted D.M.E. and they said that it was not their responsability because they didn't handle the shipping.  Which I would agree with, except that there was NOTHING wrong with the packaging; upon closer inspection, the lid of the bottle (beneath the safety seal) hadn't been properly screwed on -something that the company definitely OUGHT to take responsability for!  When I emailed the company to explain this, they never responded. In this case the shipping is very important for the review because losing nearly a third of the product before you get it makes this a VERY expensive product!

The Vitamin Shopp offers free shipping for orders over $25. This seller Trade Concepts rips people off violently. I tried to return this item since I paid $6 extra buying from Trade Concepts but the shipping is $5.98 since the shipping methods are LIMITED to UPS drop off and UPS pick up ONLY. What a clever way to prevent cheated customers from returning since the return shipping equals to the price difference the seller jacked up.

"B003XB5LMU","As someone who loves asian food and recently became intolerant of soy, this sauce is a godsend. It's pretty close to the real thing. The difference between coconut aminos and soy sauce is this product is sweeter, not as salty, and a little thin. It's a fermented product, so I found it's tastier after I've opened it and it's been sitting on my shelf a while. What I've done to make it taste more like soy sauce is to add a good fish sauce to it when I cook (use maybe 2:1 coconut aminos to fish sauce, and taste as you go). This adds saltiness, brings depth, and cuts the sweetness, making the flavor profile closer to what you need for Korean and Japanese food, where a darker soy sauce flavor profile is important.",4,"Pretty close to the real thing",1375315200,"2011-08-12"

"B003XB5LMU","Our daughter was diagnosed with allergies to Gluten, Casein & Soy when she was 18 months old.  Unfortunately, one of her favorite food treats was rice with soy sauce.  We tried making all kinds of alternative soy sauces using recipes we found online that met her allergy restrictions and nothing appealed to her taste buds.  Finally, one day we accidentally found Coconut Aminos!!  This has been a lifesaver!  We love the product, and unlike another reviewer, we DO use it for fried rice...we just add fish sauce to offset the sweetness.  We don't have any other option for soy sauce, and it works great!The only thing we do NOT like about this product is that it has a bit of an effervescent quality to it...MANY bottles that we have purchased have burst and leaked.  Also, it is a mess to pour.  I asked the company if it would harm the product at all to put it in a soy sauce type dispenser bottle and they ""didn't think so.""  LOL  We tried it and have not noticed a quality difference, so that is how we use it now...from a spouted dispenser.We feel very blessed to have found this (luckily we stumbled upon it early in her diet and she is now 3...so we have used it for 18 months or so...",5,"The ONLY Soy Sauce Alternative our Picky Eater will EAT!",1299283200,"2011-08-12"

"B003XB5LMU","I do like coconut aminos much better than soy sauce, especially now that the price has come down.  Sometimes I have to add more than the amount of soy sauce, as the flavor is more subtle.  But, it is a much healthier option as there is MUCH LESS salt and much more amino acids which are supposed to help repair and rebuild muscle tissue, enhance brain function, and give you more energy.  Plus it is gluten free.  Now that the price has come down (I spent almost $20 on my first bottle), I won't go back to salt laden soy sauce.",4,"Good Flavor, Healthier",1401667200,"2011-08-12"

We don't buy soy sauce any more nor even gluten free tamari, we just simply like coconut aminos better.  We also use it like you can use balsamic vinegar.

I'm very grateful someone has made a product like this for people who want to avoid both gluten and soy. And it's not terrible! Hooray!Do take heed of the ""65% Less Sodium than soy sauce"" label. You really can taste the lack of sodium, and to me that is disappointing, though I understand most people want to avoid high-sodium. It is even less salty than reduced-sodium soy sauce. (Please don't lecture me about the dangers of sodium, I don't want your cookie-cutter advice. Some people need plenty of salt in their diet  for medical reasons and I'm one of them.)So, if you're like me and you love dumping soy sauce in soups, over rice, etc., you will probably have to add a sprinkle of salt on top of these coconut aminos.",4,"Good flavor, finally a good substitute for soy sauce",1397779200,"2011-08-12"

"B003XB5LMU","The BEST of the aminos!  For years, I have used a soy-based organic amino product for my stir-frying.  However, since on the SCD/Paleo healthy way of eating, I had given up all soy products which included liquid aminos and most steak and stir-fry sauces/marinades.  I was making my own which was laborious and I could never keep a supply.  I tried the coconut aminos last week for the first time - WOW, this is great - far superior in taste to all of the soy or overly sweetened or overly preserved sauces or liquid aminos.  I use it on just about everything from salmon to salads and stirfry veggies.  I am getting ready to order a dozen bottles.

I just wanted to put that out there in case anyone else has a reaction and wonders if they are alone.That being said, it tastes like a less salty soy sauce to me. The one bite of rice with this that I had was tasty. Smells like soy sauce too.

"B003XB5LMU","Being Celiac, allergic to soy, and part Asian, this is a wonderful soy sauce substitute for me!  The flavor is sweeter than soy sauce, as others have mentioned, and it is not as strong.  Also, I am glad that it is organic... or I wouldn't have even tried it.  Eating ""clean"" can be challenging at times and this adds a wonderful flavor without the guilt or the queasy stomach I get from soy sauce.Two things that need improvement:  Why is there NO shaker top?  This is such a little, but HUGELY important thing!!!  The second thing is that there needs to be an option for a larger size bottle and at a more reasonable price.  Six bucks is too much for a meager 8 oz.  Add a shaker top (like every soy sauce has) and offer a 16 oz size, and I'll gladly make this a 5 star rating :)Edit 12-08-12The last two bottles I ordered came with shaker tops; hurray!  Now if they would just offer a bigger bottle and a better price!  Oh, and my last order leaked all over, but probably would not have, if the person who packed the order had not put them on their sides, rather than standing upright!

"B003XB5LMU","I recently tried Coconut Secret coconut aminos and thought it was good. It's not an exact flavor duplicate of soy sauce, but it offers the same type of savory flavor and works well as a substitute. It didn't seem as rich as soy sauce, so there were times that I needed to add a little more sauce. However, it seemed to have a little more of a fermented 'bite' to it, so adding more wasn't always appropriate to my recipe. I had to experiment a little, but I enjoyed seeing what I could do with it.I was attracted to the coconut aminos because it's a non-GMO product and the sodium level is about a third of regular soy sauce, or about half of most reduced sodium soy sauces. It's hard to find non-GMO soy sauce. Bourbon Barrel soy sauce is non-GMO and delicious, but it is not low in sodium and it's not as easy to find as the Coconut Secret product. I plan to buy this again for some of my recipes, but will still use regular soy sauce at times because this didn't work with all of my recipes.

"B0042DIZIU","Loves me my pistachios, but the prices keep escalating due to shortages caused by draught and thefts. Whole truckloads of nuts get stolen in California's central valley because of their value. Still, I had to take off a star because the price is really too high, regardless.These individual packs are the best way around that for me. They stay fresh far longer and I tend to stop at eating at one bag instead of downing a big bag that allures me with more, more, more and I can't stop. This means that my nut habit is less costly and the nuts are better for a longer time.Over the years it seems that the Wonderful brand is consistently higher quality than some others, rarely the cheapest though. They have just enough salt and are roasted to a good crispiness. Limp or unsalted pistachios are simply awful.Suggested pairing: decent bourbon, scotch, beer or wine. In Colorado...you know. There must be a huge pistachio market high up there.This is how I intend to buy my pistachios from now on. It is the best deal for me.",4,"Nut fix",1405036800,"2016-03-09"

"B0042DIZIU","I used to eat these all the time.  They're crunchy, never stale, very consistent quality.  However, it seems that in the past few months, there has suddenly been an extraordinary number of empty shells in the bag - every bag.  By extraordinary, I mean as much as a quarter of a cup of empty shells in an 8 oz bag.  The shells alone don't weigh all that much, so they don't appreciably affect the weight of a single package.  But if you take that tiny little bit that they are stealing per package and multiply it by the tens of thousands of bags (conservatively) that they package each month, the total weight of the shells must be astronomical, which means the total excess cost to consumers is unconscionable.

The roasting is perfect and they're lightly salted, just as I like them. The little bags are handy for snacks and lunches and are a way of keeping me in check when it comes to eating them. The pistachios are nicely opened and I've only found two ""uncracked"" so far. I save them in a pile and use the nutcracker on them when I get enough. The sodium content of a serving is quite modest relative to a lot of other nuts. The fat and calorie content is fairly high, but it's a less-harmful fat. The fiber and protein are moderately good.

"B0042DIZIU","2/5 stars. Why did I need to pick through half stale pistachios? I don't know either. It was quite annoying. Especially since I bought a pack of FIVE.Reason why I think this happened:Salt is a preservative. It locks away moisture and creates a inhospitable environment for microorganisms to flourish.

If you are looking for salted and roasted pistachios these are some of the best you will ever find. I've tried other brands and haven't been as impressed. In fact I didn't think I liked pistachios that much before trying this particular brand. They are not overly salty - just enough to make them good.

It may be a bit more expensive this way, but it is worth it to me.  I would actually choose the shelled pistachios the next time.... so it is a bit quicker to eat.

"B00474CIGY","I used to snag these from my Mother when I was a kid just thinking they were a milkshake.  I remember them filling me up pretty good , almost to the point of feeling sick. Well,maybe it's because I'm older now but they don't give me that really full feeling anymore.  I can just barely tell that it subdues my appetite a bit.  I personally would recommend GNC's powder which they sell at Sam's club and Ebay for around 20 bucks a can.  It curbs hunger the same but it also has protein which Alba does not.  The only thing Alba has on the GNC brand is less calories but if your working out like I do you need the protein post work out anyway.  I suppose if you weren't working out this would be the better one because of the lower calories.  So why wouldn't you get the GNC one?  I&#34;m too lazy to go in my kitchen and look at it but it's pretty easy to find.  If you really want to know the name and volume you can message this post and I'll look it up.  It's an appetite suppressant with the protein. I have faith you'll find it.  Much more bang for the buck!",3,"Not as good as I remember.  Get a shake with protein if your working out as well.

My husband and I are not on roller coaster diets, but he is diabetic so I'm always looking for treats he can have.. Alba's are pretty low in carbs (12 carbs, 10 net carbs), so it's a nice treat for us both.. They are really expensive, though, here on Amazon and I can't find them in any stores.. Every place I've looked on the internet says they are out of stock or they are also priced ridiculously high.. Geeze.. we used to buy a box for something like $1.80 back in the day.I purchased the double fudge, only because it was more affordable, but as I remember them, I think the milk chocolate is probably the best...But the double fudge is thick,creamy and delicious, too...",5,"Ahhhh.....thick and creamy Alba shakes..",1370908800,"2009-07-02"

First of all they don't have a chemically taste because they don't have all the chemicals and second of all they have the perfect amount of sugar so that I can enjoy one package and not feel the need to go get 15 more. They taste 100 times better without all the chemicals and sugar. As it says on the packaging &#34;Think of your favorite peanut butter cup. Magnify that feeling by a gazillion&#34; That's Justins.

Missing the saltiness that gives peanut butter cups their classic salty/sweet combo.#2- The peanut butter has no peanut flavor.#3- The chocolate has no flavor and its has a firm texture that has awkward mouth feel.#4- The proportion of chocolate to peanut butter is off. I like mine with less choco, a little more peanut butter.I bought these Justin's PB cups at my local super market. I love PB cups so I was exited to try an organic one. I'm sorry but they are bland and I wont buy these again. I did see the label says gluten free. Maybe if you have to eat gluten free these are relatively good. They are relatively expensive too.

I checked Amazon hoping to find them to be a little more affordable so they could be a frequent lunch treat, and I was surprised to find that they are more expensive if you take the shipping into account.

Usually when I buy organic, the taste isn't really that great, but Justin's was even better than Newman's (which is like almost liquidy dripping -not that tasty- peanut butter coming out of a melting chocolate shell.)  Justin's is a firmer tasty peanut butter filling in a firm tasty chocolate shell.  It's organic, vegan so a better alternative to Reese's but still tasty.",5,"firm and tasty...YUM!!",1312416000,"2012-09-26"

I can eat it! It's certified gluten free and thus not made in a factory that processes wheat, unlike a lot of the other fancy peanut butter cups. It also doesn't have the preservative TBHQ like Reese's, of which I am also intolerant.I'd like to make my own peanut butter cups because it's cheaper, but when a quick sweet treat is needed these are dandy.",5,"Perfect.

"B004F4GH5E","I don't eat chocolate often, and when I do, I'm picky about it.These were delightful and surprising.The chocolate is made using organic and fair trade ingredients. What surprised me was the nice amount of snap to the chocolate. Generally peanut butter cups don't have much snap, and milk chocolate has less snap than dark chocolate. The texture of the chocolate is very smooth, and you can taste the vanilla added to enhance the chocolate flavor. The peanut butter was also a surprise. I saw sea salt on the ingredients list at the very end so I wasn't expecting much salty flavor. The peanut butter is salty-sweet with occasional tiny granules of peanuts or salt, just the right light touch of salt.It's also sweetened and has a touch of the vanilla like the chocolate. The chocolate and peanut butter are great together, with the flavors of both complimenting each other nicely.My daughter who is a lot less picky than I am loved them as well, and said she prefers them to Reese's. These will be my peanut butter cup fix in the future.",5,"Nice snap to the chocolate.",1353196800,"2012-09-26"
"B004F4GH5E","I was so excited to find these peanut butter cups at our local market. I love peanut butter cups...they are my all time favorite chocolate choice. I had to stop getting the ""Reeces"" kind because of the corn syrup in the ingredients. I was also glad to see that these were organic. How much better can you get? Well...I thought they were the biggest disappoint I have ever had in a candy. The texture was fine, but the taste was almost inedible. I actually didn't even finish one of the cups and then threw the rest away. I didn't think it was even possible to make a bad peanut butter cup. I give it to Justin's brand to be making an organic, corn free alternative to our favorites, but I won't be buying these anymore. I actually found an alternative at Trader Joe's that doesn't have corn in them and while they are not organic they taste GREAT and I will be sticking with those for now.",1,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT",1318636800,"2012-09-26"

"B004HZFASG","I've been trying different granola recipes from Lori Carter's 'Variations on a Theme: Granola' cookbook. I've had a lot of fun & success with the different granola recipes - which have been great as snacks, breakfast or in lieu of oatmeal when I make bread in the bread machine. One of the more intriguing ones called for Pistachios - a nut I had never tried before - mainly because they looked messy, hard on the hands to shell & I wasn't sure the color was natural. Also, there have been a few very pretty biscotti recipes that called for Pistachios I'd like to try.The pistachios I found in the store were very expensive for itty bitty bags. When I found these on the Amazon site, I decided to give them a try. Whoa - these are way too good right out of the bag! Once my 20-something kids found them hidden in the bakery section of the kitchen, the level in the bag diminshed so quickly that to actually get any of the baking done I'll have to order more right away!I have no experience but general nut-eating to gauge their quality by. I found them to have a pleasing nutty & salty scent, a softer bite than a peanut or cashew, and a buttery taste similar to a cashew. Their green color was basically uniform throughout the bag. The bag is heavyweight and its ziplock seals like most of its kind (requiring a bit of finger fumbling to get open or closed again). The price has gone up some since I bought them several months ago so that's a bit daunting - but its a big bag & I have some snack mixes I'm experimenting with now - not to mention the granola!",5,"Great Taste, Keeps Well, Too Easy to Eat!",1355443200,"2016-03-09"

There are so many great things that can be made with raw nuts like these for a raw vegan.  Plus our dogs love them too.  We like to eat things we can share with our dogs.

"B004V6A9SC","Opened the jar, heated some up and was soooo looking forward to that first taste.  I mean, how could anything with Paul Newman's handsome, smiling face be anything but wonderful??  Once I took that first taste, I wondered why it didn't taste like ANY other cheese queso I had ever had - even the gloppy canned kind you get squirted onto nachos at a little league baseball game.  It was awful.  The overpowering stench of vomit coupled with the SOUR undertones that absolutely no cheese sauce of any kind should ever have ... yeah.  That was hideous.  Put it in the fridge & forgot about it.  Husband ate some lastnight (I neglected to voice my opinion about the salsa since I thought maybe it was just me) and has been paying for it ever since.  He thought it was &#34;bad&#34; because of the vomit smell but it wasn't old and had stayed refrigerated since I opened it a few days ago.  Nevertheless, I sent him off to work with some Pepto Bismol.  As someone else mentioned here - this stuff is SO horrible that it forced me to look up reviews!  If you've never tried this nastiness in a jar, do yourself a favor and DON'T waste your money, even if the store is giving it away for free.

So I guess you could say that you get what you pay for. I was having a party and I was about to serve this chemical waste. I opened the jar and saw that the oils had seperated so I stirred it up. I dipped and chip to taste. OMG, HORRIBLE!!!! It smelled like ass and tasted like vomit. Didnt taste anything like queso. It tasted like greasy ass chease, i could taste mostly the vinegar which is something that salsa is usually made with but this was just foul. I thought ""maybe its expired""... Nope, date is still good. ""Maybe it needs to be heated up?""... Nope, just tasted like warm chemical waste after that. Im going to try to take it back to today to see if I can get my money back.

"B004V6A9SC","This was on sale at the local grocery store so I thought I'd give it a try.  Its absolutely horrible.  I am not a picky eater, I'll eat almost anything.  After a few bites of this, I threw it in the trash.  I hate the thought of wasting food, but this is vomit in a jar.  I was fooled by the fancy label, and the Newmans Own brand usually being quality.  What really offended me was the vomit smell upon opening the jar, and then the vomit taste when I dipped my tortilla chip in the toxic goo.  Like I said, I hate wasting food, so I thought I would tough it out and force myself to eat some more.  A few bites later, I was violently throwing the jar in my garbage.  I was forced to snack on plain tortilla chips, how boring.  This product should be banished from existence. What infuriates me is the part of the label that says ""so good it oughta be outlawed"".  An outright lie sir!  How about a new label that says ""so vomitey you'll think you ate your own vomit"", and Newmans face green and frowning.",1,"the worst",1342396800,"2014-02-18"
"B004V6A9SC","I love eating chips and Queso while reading graphic novels, and when I saw that all profits from Newman's Own brands go to charity I decided to to try it. I excitedly procured some, stocked up on reading material and prepared to enjoy an evening of artistic and epicurean delights. However, such was not to be.Upon opening the container I was reminded of that unfortunate time my roommate at ComicCon decided to wear that thick foam Gamorrean guard costume for 14 hours in San Diego weather then took it off when we got back to our room. It wasn't quite as bad as my cousin returning from a 3 day Phish concert but still very unpleasant. I immediately had to ask myself ""Did I err?""Hoping for the best I microwaved it, but this is where things went terribly wrong. Without my glasses on I thought I'd pressed 3:33, but mistakenly pressed 6:66, which almost proved my undoing. A strange cloud of greenish and orange vapor filled the kitchen, my cat screeched and scrambled upstairs as if a Wampa was trying to eat it. She ran past the incoming dog who thought it smelled fresh vomit to be licked up off the floor, but soon realized his terrible mistake and shot out the dog door as if a Gorn wielding a makeshift flint knife was about to stab him.Terrified but curious, I lifted my Firefly shirt to cover my mouth & nose and carefully pried open the microwave. The horrific sight that greeted me was reminiscent of the creature from Carpenter's The Thing morphing into another form. An aberrant abomination of bubbly and spindly steaming dark orange goo that appeared to be growing spindly legs out of it's bottle, presumably in order to chase me down and consume my DNA. Speechless and wishing I had MacReady behind me wielding a flamethrower to incinerate this unworldly beast I realized that I had to fend for myself. My first thought was the fire extinguisher, which had no effect and actually seemed to make it angrier. Now speckled with white powder the freakish construct leapt to the kitchen counter and aimlessly moved around like a Dalek blinded by rage.Suddenly this jar with Paul Newman's smiling, mustachioed, sombrero wearing face was now angrily running around on six thin gooey orange legs protruding from it's top. To say it was surreal would be an obvious statement only Pavel Chekov could make with a straight face.I quickly retrieved my Highlander sword and attempted to cleave it in two, but the blade broke into 3 pieces. (And boy am I going to have a few words with that dealer at DragonCon about this happening. If that was ""Full Tang stainless steel"" then I'm Reed Richards.)Out of ideas I decided it was time to call 911 and ran for the phone. As I came back into the kitchen the Queso was consuming the contents of the sugar jar and visibly growing in size.Whilst attempting to explain this rather unique situation to the 911 operator the Queso monster jumped to the floor and scrambled out the dog door into the night. I flung the door open but it was nowhere to be seen, the dog was gone as well. Unfortunately it's collar wasn't, so I fear the worst. I heard trash cans being knocked over and cats screeching as it escaped down the alley.Worst Queso ever.",1,"Even Groo the Wanderer wouldn't eat this cheese dip.",1359331200,"2014-02-18"

STIFF consistency when chilled (or even at room temperature), it has a nasty sort of taste to it. Somewhat moldy, essentially the sort of taste you may associate with something long-since expired. Compared to brands like Tostitos or On the Border, it fails miserably. It's not even as good as the cheese dip from those nacho Lunchables. (And those are, admittedly, fairly nice.)It's a shame, since all proceeds are supposed to go to charity. A better product would do wonders for that noble cause.

It had just finished heating when the family returned.  They walked in the house and covered their noses.  One said it smelled like a terrible poopy diaper.  Another said it smelled like vomit.

"B004V6A9SC","My friends and I are having a big 21st birthday party for two of our friends. I've always been in charge of food, lately everyone has been all over my recipe for Nachos (basically a premade nacho cheese sauce I beef up with flavors, meat, tomatoes etc. etc. etc.)Here I was about 12 hours before the party and got ready to make the nacho cheese sauce. When I had visited the store a few hours prior I saw the Newman's Own Con Queso, it was on sale and i needed a lot ($2.00 vs. $3.79 of my usual brand) and I love Newman's Own salad dressing, I trust the brand you could say.Came home, browned up three lbs. of ground beef, added refried beans, all the extras and poured in about seven jars of this. I was met by a repulsing smell. I tasted the queso after it had been poured into about 30.00 of extras and was severely disappointed with this crap. it tasted like plastic and vomit, it was just plain horrible. I will never stray from my usual tostidos brand queso dip now.I immediately poured the queso mixture into a colander and had to rinse away the nasty queso trying to salvage my meat and beans and jalepenos and extras. It was a nightmare. Ended up spending twice as much as if I had just bought my usual brand in the first place... Plus now the party is only a few hours away, haven't slept, showered, or set up and wasting precious time recooking my queso sauce..i am so disappointed I had to get on Amazon and hopefully save some other people from queso doom!",1,"Newman's Own Vomit..",1376784000,"2014-02-18"

"B004V6A9SC","My husband picked this up today because he couldn't find our usual Tostitos Con Queso. I opened the jar to try it. It shook like jello, which was my first turn-off. But I was like okay, I'll at least give it a try. One mouthful of this stuff and I was spitting it back out. I agree with another reviewer that said they couldn't believe this crud actually passed a taste test. If it even went through one. I should also mention that this is December of 2012 and it has an expiry date of 2014. So, really? This stuff can sit unopened for 2 years before it goes bad? Turn-off number two. Then I asked my husband to try it, just to see his reaction. He looked at it, smelled it, then pitched it into the trash saying, ""Sorry, but I can't get it past my nose, there's no way I'm putting it into my mouth.""I thought it was just me, so I came to Amazon to check out other reviews, only to discover that 100% of the people who reviewed this item felt the same as me. It truly does smell and taste like vomit. Why it's still on the shelves at the store is beyond me.

"B004V6A9SC","I love the Newman's brand - the lemonade, pasta sauces (alfredo, multiple types of marinara), salad dressings (we use 3 kinds), salsa, etc., and was psyched to see this queso (one of my very favorite junk foods) in the chip aisle.  Buuut then I opened it.  Strike 1 - it was orange, almost glowing.  Not appetizing looking.  I could also see the 'gloppy' chunks (which was weird because I had remarked how it was a bit watery when I tipped it into the shopping cart).  And then I tasted it... wow.  It tasted sour and reminiscent of chemicals with a battery-like aftertaste.  Then my husband and daughter tasted it.  Her horrified look spoke more loudly than words and my husband stated simply ""It's gone bad."". We checked the expiration date (fine) and I was sure I had heard the seal pop.  After an hour, it was bugging me so badly that I came to my trusted Amazon to read reviews and assure myself it was just a bad jar.  Nope.  This stuff is repellent.  I don't know how it got to the grocery store shelves and I have no idea how it has stayed on them.Don't do it.",1,"Just confused.",1355443200,"2014-02-18"
"B004V6A9SC","I just wasted a burrito by pouring some of this queso over it. My mistake for not tasting it first. I smells like vomit in a jar.

"B004V6A9SC","I bought this last week from a market that carries the most expensive products in my area. So, I assumed they carried products that had passed the sniff and taste test. I opened it and dipped my chip in and swallowed it. I then became immediately sick. It tasted lake vomit. I opened the 2nd jar - same thing. I called the market and told them about it and that the whole lot they purchased must be rancid. I assured them that the lid was on secure and it popped upon opening. So it had to be something that happened at the factory. They said whatever the reason to throw it out and they would refund my money. I just decided  to do a search because I was relly puzzled. Well, it seems that, not only on Amazon but on other sites, the reviews were awful. I think I will email and write the company. This stuff is the most foul food I have ever tasted. I actually asked myself if this was the only food I had to eat would I? The answer is no because it actually made me vomit.",1,"Rancid?",1361664000,"2014-02-18"
"B004V6A9SC","I did not come here to write a review, but rather stumbled upon the review section upon looking to see if there was an active recall for this product.  There was something amiss from the second I opened the jar.  The cheese dip inside was of a thicker consistency than other salsa con queso I've bought in the past, and believe you me, I'm no stranger to salsa con queso.  Then the stench hit me.  Vomit is what I'm seeing most people compare the smell and taste to, though I would have to argue that it smells very strongly of dirty feet.  And when I say strong, I mean strong.  I'm fortunate I was sitting when I opened this vile thing because the stench would have knocked me to the floor.That was when I decided to check the expiration date.  Still good, according to no one but the jar itself.  I paid $2.50 of my hard working bucks for this stuff, so I should at least taste it.  It tastes as bad as it smells.Overall, I like the Newman's Own brand.  I usually get their regular salsas.  But this...  I don't understand how something could go so horribly wrong.  I only had a taste, but my stomach is starting to gurgle uncomfortably even as I write this.  If I die, you know who did it.",1,"It really is that bad.",1373587200,"2014-02-18"

Eeeeewwwww!!!! What did I just put in my mouth!!!? I check the expiration- nope, it's good for another year and a half. I haven't brushed my teeth in a few hours so it's not that funky combo taste you get from toothpaste either. Ok, let's try another bite... Maybe it was just a weird first bite. Omg, this is soooo unbelievably gross. I can't believe it's marketed and sold.

This particular flavor is one of my favorites, along with the Coconut Cashew Crisp, PB Chocolate Chip, and Dark Chocolate Hazelnut.  In addition to great taste, I also feel very balanced after eating them.  They are very nutritious, free of artificials, and most flavors are free of gluten, dairy, and soy (three things I avoid like the plague!).As for the person who gave these a three stars because they melted on arrival, (that gave me a five-star LAUGH!)&#8230; simply throw them in the fridge, (or the if you're in a hurry the freezer will work quite well), and in no time they will be good as new.  Seriously, unless you're planning to open them, put them on a plate, and serve them at a fancy party where appearance would be important, the fridge or freezer will have them tasting good as new in no time!Interestingly enough (living in Southern Arizona), my bars were not melted on arrival.

"B004YLD7SS","From shelled to unshelled, flavored to unflavored, Setton's are the freshest pistachios I've tried. With shelled pistachios, it's hard to taste the freshness. And even in unshelled pistachios, they taste airy and unflavorful compared to these. If you find yourself thinking that unshelled pistachios are a pain, because the pesty little shells are preventing you from stuffing your face silly with these green little flavor punchers, think again. Setton Farms pistachios are crazy fresh. I'm never going back to Costco pistachios, TJ's pistachios, are Whole Foods pistachios again. 32 ounces? I thought it was going to last me at least two months when I ordered these ( a 16-oz bag from TJ's or WF lasts me about that long) but I pretty much hoarded them in a secret stash and finished it in less than two weeks.For those who are watching their sodium intake though, please use self-control when eating these! These are seriously good, but also quite salty (previous reviewer, maybe you got a less salty batch, maybe I got very salty batches, or maybe Setton Farms doesn't mix their salt in with the pistachios evenly). After a handful of these, your lips and tongue are going to start feeling the effects of touching so much salt. That being said, Setton's pistachios are crispy, not old and airy, and soooo sweet. Never realized what a pistachio really tasted like till these. Best of all, it's just pistachios and salt, and not a bunch of other weird ingredients in there like you might find in flavored pistachios or in Costco pistachios, but they are just as flavorful. Downfall: about $2-4 more expensive  per pound than if you buy at TJ, WF, or Costco, and  if you are a picky eater, you probably won't find other brands of pistachios as satisfying anymore.",5,"Freshest Pistachios Everrr",1333152000,"2009-04-06"

"B00555H0LC","I loved Nutella until I read the label and saw the ingredients in it, it's a paragraph long and has unhealthy processed fats for a main complaint, and a high sugar load. Nutella:  20 grams of sugar, 12 g fat, 200 calories in one serving - 2 Tablespoons). Justin's: 7 grams sugar, 15 g fat, 180 calories in one serving - 2 Tablespoons).I tried this for the first time in the summer of 2013 (after the recipe change apparently, mine contains almonds and hazelnuts) and I love it. This actually has a nuttier taste of hazelnuts plus the chocolate than Nutella does. It tastes more like the real foods and not bordering on a frosting taste. There is less sugar in Justin's so it is not super sweet either.The only problem with the product stems from the unhealthy ingredients is lacks. The lack of processing it further to make it really creamy like a creamy peanut butter like Skippy or like Nutella is, is what keeps it healthier for our bodies. But, sometimes it separates or gets a thick clog on the bottom and it takes some stirring to mix it up and it is not always smooth like Skippy. I am sure you know what I mean. Now the good thing is that it is not really separating or thick and unstirrable like the product is when you grind your own nuts at the store for natural cashew butter or natural peanut butter. Justin's Nut Butter is much smoother than that.I was tempted to downrate this to 4 stars based on it being not super smooth but I corrected my judgment because I rate health and better nutrition and less sugar as more important, so I rate this product 5 stars = I Love It.This is not an exact replica of Nutella.

That may put some off if they are used to the sugary taste of the other one and expect that.

"B00555H0LC","I first tried Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Blend Nut Butter a few years ago when it first came out.  It was delicious--a much healthier substitute for the tastyNutella, 26.5 Ounce Jar.  I like this product so much, I even registered for Auto-Delivery as the price of three was so much less expensive than what my local health food store was offering.  Unfortunately, as with all good things, this tasty treat transformed into a product much less desirable in its present form.  Auto-Delivery was firmly cancelled and my pantry still houses two unopened jars of this awful mixture.Firstly, the company must have decided to change the formula and add almonds to the blend.  The hazelnut taste is usurped by this blander and less coveted flavor.  In addition, whatever blending process was once used, obviously has been abandoned.  The current product contains bits of shells that are nasty to feel on your tongue and between your teeth.  I am surprised that someone hasn't sued the company for a broken tooth.  The once wholesome grittiness of this product has been pushed to the limit--better to use it as an abrasive cleanser than to eat it.  Lastly, whatever oil used to sit on top of the jar in its second reincarnation has been leached away resulting in a grout consistency that just doesn't work.  At least with the oil, the product could have been mixed--although this was difficult in itself to maneuver, but at least some degree of smoothness resulted.Bottom line?  Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Nut Butter used to be a great product.  The company changed the formula and ruined the fact that they, indeed, had crafted a healthier brand of Nutella.  I guess they could not sustain the great quality and opted for something less tasty and less presentable in terms of consistency.  Beware:  the pieces of shell in the blend can be the cause of some expensive dental work.  Not recommended.

"B00555H0LC","I love Nutella but I could not feed it to my infant - it has waaaaay too much sugar, and neither of us are milk fans. I wanted to find a vegan-ish version and voila! Justin's to the rescue. I am new to this particular flavor, the chocolate hazelnut blend. It is delicious. Sure, its not smooth like Nutella (which really is nothing more than icing), and it is indeed gritty and grainy, but its freaking yum yum yum. I have no trouble smoothing it onto toast, or smearing a teensy bit onto whole grain waffles for the toddler. I do not know the previous recipe (the one that was not a 'blend') so I cannot comment on the difference. But I like that this has low sugar, high chocolate and hazelnut flavor, and an ending hint of salted almonds. To summarize: not smooth like nutella or other milk/processed brands, but delicious and as nutritious as you can get if you need chocolate on everything. I am a health nut and my baby doesn't get much sugar, and I'm happy giving this to him and my family.

This is the best hazelnut butter because it is not overly sweet and has a nice salty taste as well.  As far as texture, we have eaten several jars and never had a nut shell.  It isn't super smooth, but no chunks.  I would say more grainy texture.  Great for dipping strawberries in, apples or eating straight from the jar.  The cost is a little high, but I would much rather pay extra for a quality product.  Worth the price.",5,"Very good!",1368748800,"2013-08-16"

"B00555H0LC","I purchased this in a healthfood store, and absolutely l oved it on Ritz crackers. When I needed a refill, I had moved and needed to order online. I saw the reviews and figured a few people got bad batches, but sure enough, I got a jar of gritty, flavorless goop. Even after stirring, whipping, shaking and darned near blending the bottle, it was not the same consistency as my first jar. It was grainy, and the oil refuses to blend in with the hazelnuts and cocoa. When I taste it, it barely has any flavor, which makes me confused as to what the stuff is made up of. It tastes like stale almond butter with a hint of hazelnuts, and maybe a dash of cocoa. I hate almond butter, so of course I'm not a fan. I also am pretty sure I can taste more palm fruit oil than cocoa butter. I would NEVER purchase this product online again, especially not through Amazon. It's a waste of money. If you see it in a store, buy it there. I'm so disappointed.",1,"Not the Same as Store Bought",1401148800,"2013-08-16"

Alarmingly, I find myself going through jars rather quickly. A costly affair, this, hence one star off for price, but oh, so delicious.",4,"Delicious",1351036800,"2013-08-16"

Well, I fell in love with it and quickly became addicted!  It's really very yummy!However, I am terribly disappointed with the version in a jar.  I have eaten my way through several jars in the past year, and every single jar has bits of nut shell in it.  It hurts my teeth when I crunch down on it, and it is incredibly frustrating.  It's the same experience as having a bit of bone in your hamburger. I have to eat it very carefully.I have also purchased a few cases of the single serving packets over the past year, and they have never, not once, had a bit of nut shell in those little packets.

I know I'm not the only fan who noticed.Yes, I know hazelnuts can be iffy in supply, but so what? Nuts keep well.

It also has a weird flavor. I can't describe the weirdness of the flavor, it's just not good. It has less sugar than Nutella, but not that much less for what you sacrifice in taste. Nut butter with chocolate is going to be a treat food anyways, so you might as well get one that tastes good. I had to return this because nobody in my house would eat it. We are healthy eaters. We eat lots of live raw foods and my kids drink green juice and smoothies with a lot of green in them, so it's not like we are people who live on McDonald's and our taste buds are ruined from eating garbage.

"B005M4AM5M","I previously ordered the .5oz individual cups and they came from the natural Health Shoppe. This was my original review: Peanut butter cups are one of my favorite candies, and since going vegan I have really missed them. I heard about Justin's Dark Chocolate PB cups and knew I must try them immediately. I read a ton of reviews and noticed it was really hit or miss with ordering them on Amazon, but I tried anyway because I don't have these in any health food stores near me -- actually, I don't even really have any health food stores at all!Unfortunately, they showed up stale and brittle, and the peanut butter is almost white, and nearly flavorless. They also kind of burn my tongue a little, which is strange.I can tell that if these were in good condition they would most likely be delicious.. but these ones from a lot of Amazon's sellers are not.--Well, I gave these a second chance and ordered them from another seller.

They didn't feel like a treat.",1,"Disapppointed- these are not one of their better product",1377475200,"2012-09-26"
"B005M4AM5M","I prefer to eat straight chocolate, but every now and then I think everyone craves a more &#8220;guilty&#8221; pleasure (whether something like a Snickers bar or Reese&#8217;s cups) and I think Justin&#8217;s peanut butter cups fills this gap in a tastier, healthier, and more sustainable way. When you first try them they may seem different to what you&#8217;re used to (sweeter than dark chocolate, not as sweet as the options mentioned above) but there&#8217;s a good chance that they&#8217;ll grow on you and you&#8217;ll eventually be craving more. I&#8217;m not even that nuts (ho ho) about peanut butter, but Justin&#8217;s cups have converted me&#8212;there&#8217;s a good balance between chocolate and peanut butter. I&#8217;m not going to discuss quality issues related to the supplier; I&#8217;d suggest buying a pack locally if you want to try them out, and after that be cautious about who you buy them from (check out the other reviews). The ingredients are organic and Rainforest Alliance certified. Justin&#8217;s mention in their press releases and website product info that their chocolate is also fair trade, but there&#8217;s no fair trade certification stamp on the product itself. The Rainforest Alliance states that their standards and practices have impacts on local communities that are equivalent to those of fair trade initiatives.If you eat two of Justin&#8217;s cups that&#8217;s 8% of your salt daily value (dv) and 14 grams of sugar. That compares to 5% dv salt and 28 grams of sugar in a regular Snickers bar, and 6% dv salt / 31 grams sugar in a 2-pack of Reese&#8217;s peanut butter cups. So, Justin&#8217;s have half the sugar, but actually higher in salt than the &#8220;competition&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think Justin&#8217;s cups would lose anything if they reduced the salt content &#8211; they definitely taste a tad salty to me. All things considered, I&#8217;m not going to eat any more Snickers or Reese&#8217;s if I can help it&#8212;the impact on society and the planet is too great (see below).There can be a huge difference in impact between buying chocolate that is considered &#8220;fair trade&#8221; and that which is not. On one hand you can support a sustainable business that in addition to giving workers a fair wage also helps the community in which the cacao is grown; on the other hand (think large multinational chocolate makers) the cheaper chocolate may come at the price of a very poor standard of life for workers, communities that don&#8217;t benefit, and even child slavery. Child slavery is predominantly an issue in West Africa, where children can be sold by relatives or abducted from neighboring countries, and are forced to work long days under difficult conditions, harvesting cacao pods and missing an education in the process. Mars, Nestle, and (eventually) Hershey have issued statements that their cacao will be child-slavery-free by 2020&#8212;so until then you know there&#8217;s a tragic human cost behind their chocolate. Reese&#8217;s is owned by Hershey while Snicker&#8217;s are made by Mars.Organic certification is very significant when it comes to chocolate &#8212;more pesticide is used to grow conventional cacao than almost any other crop, so organic certification is really important. For example, lindane (a neurotoxic organochlorine pesticide that bioaccumulates through the food chain) is commonly used on Cacao and is considered moderately hazardous, compromising the nervous and immune systems as well as posing a cancer risk. And yes, it has been detected in many conventional chocolate bars. It has been banned for agricultural use in the E.U. and U.S. now (which means it&#8217;s still in use for now in cacao-producing countries but being phased out, hopefully not replaced by some equally dubious compound in intensive farms; DDT preceded lindane and is still used on a few cacao farms). Besides the risk to the consumer, conventional (non-organic, non-shade-grown) cacao farming can be very bad news for tropical rainforests and the wildlife within.Overall, I&#8217;d give it 5/5 gold stars for quality of the product and 5/5 &#8220;green&#8221; stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it.",5,"Delicious!

When they are bad, the peanut butter inside is hard, chalky, and discolored to a very light color, and barely tastes like peanut butterI have been running about 50/50 in the experience so I've honestly stopped buying them because they can be pricey, and the chances aren't in my favor enough.

"B005MHRB7G","I normally love Plum products, and when I ordered Pumpkin and Banana, I thought it would be a perfect mix for my 18 month old.  He took one bite, and spit it out.  Confused, I tasted it, and was shocked by how sour it was! After reading the ingredients, I saw they put lemon juice in the mix.  I now have bags of food my children refuse to eat.  Very disappointed!!",1,"Way too Sour!",1329868800,"2013-11-08"
"B005MHRB7G","My daughter started out not really digging food.  She warmed up to pears right away and was really particular about what else she liked.  Mostly fruit (mango, pineapple, pear, blueberry) she would eat and peas on their own, forget it!  I was a bit reluctant to try this flavor out seeing as my daughter absolutely refused to eat peas after trying them once.  To my surprise she loved it!  Loved it so much she ate nearly the entire packet in one sitting (unheard of for her).  This is now a regular staple in our rotation and she simply can't get enough.  As a Mom, I'm delighted she is so into veggies, I am happy to spend any amount of money on these little suckers as long as she's happy eating them.Convenient pouches last for days in the fridge once opened.  Easy to take anywhere with us, including traveling.  The spoon attachments are really handy for these, but my little one enjoys eating straight from the bag. Slurp slurp slurp!Messy with the green, so be sure to use a bib.  Otherwise, hands down one of my favorite baby foods on the market.",5,"Hard to believe this one gets 5 stars, right?  My daughter loves this!",1328140800,"2013-11-08"
"B005MHRB7G","l am happy that even when the blends combine a binder such as apples it also combines other foods such as broccoli, because prior to using plum organics, most of the first foods, caused constipation.  Switching to plum organics provides nice variety away from sweet potatoes, just bananas, or just apples in many beginning foods.  Plum organics are also very fruity and good tasting (some sweeter than others) but you could also taste the vegetables (in some more than others).  I personally prefer it to Gerber foods -also much thicker than Gerber foods.  I found Gerber to be too watery.",5,"Great combination",1368835200,"2013-11-08"

"B005MHRB7G","This is my go to choice for premade baby food. I love the packaging, making it easy to throw in the diaper bag and pull out whenever needed. I like the ingredients a lot more than similar products. It is just the pureed vegetables and some lemon juice to keep it from spoiling. My kids love it and it is always a treat when we are out and I can grab one. It took them a little while to figure out how to suck it out and I normally have to push up the last of it for the one year olds. Great product, would recommend it.",4,"Great Item",1351123200,"2013-11-08"
"B005MHRB7G","arrived quickly; apples disguise the broccoli a little, still has a bit of a broccoli hint, but not much.  Definitely great for quick snack or to add to another food for increased nutrition...especially the broccoli.

"B005MHRB7G","We first started our little guy with Spinach/Peas/Pear and he loves it. Now we continue on with Brocoli/Apple and he also loves it. I tasted both and they are pretty good.

"B005MHRB7G","Healthy, tasty and portable.  These packets are great 'on-the-go' and perfect for the gym bag.  When you can't tote around fresh, this is the next best option.

"B005MHRB7G","I didn't give this a one-star rating because my husband and I will drink it ourselves.  However, my daughter tried it and didn't care at all for it.

"B005MHRB7G","First, the flavor is great for our little one.  He loves sweet potatoes.  Second, the design is amazing...  We primarily use these for on the go.  It is a huge help at a restaurant.  We continue to hear from others that they have never seen these before, so if you haven't tried it, please do.  We started with the spoon attachment which is great for a smaller child, but we shortly moved up to allowing him to hold it and suck through the top.

"B005MHRB7G","These were a lifesaver for a good 6 months, from about 14 months until about 20 months. They're just the right amount to stow a couple in the diaper bag for a better snack than Goldfish or crackers, and easy enough for him to eat by himself. However, the last few months - he's done with them. As in, won't even touch them. Maybe they're not complex enough, or maybe they're just too mushy, but he's not pleased.Pros:- A variety of organic flavors encompassing a number of different types of fruits and vegetables.- While we made all our own baby food, it was too hard to transport and keep stable. These work great in a pinch.- He could eat them all alone, without mommy or daddy helping out. That made them a great option when we just HAD to do something (like, you know, eat at a restaurant).Cons:- I dislike the cap size and shape. It's too easy to misplace, and too small so it could be a nice choking hazard.- The flavors are simple, with no spice or more flavored options to keep older kids a bit more interested.Overall, a very good product, but minus one star for the cap design. Pick them up at Babies R Us and you can mix and match flavors, often at excellent prices. Amazon could offer mixed boxes and that would be a huge benefits.",4,"Our 14 month old loved them.

The form factor is great for traveling.The serving size is great - we get 2 servings out of each.Important to note though - pear is the first ingredient. I took off a star for this, as the name of the product is &#34;spinach, peas, and pear&#34; which to me, implies that spinach and peas are more prevalent than pear.  So with pear being the #1 ingredient, of course it has a bit more sugar than other organic baby foods.The price was good for these, I just wish they had put pear 3rd on the list.",4,"Baby enjoyed this!",1363478400,"2013-11-08"

I end up chasing her around the house, trying to force feed yogurt, pudding, apples, bananas, broccoli, ANYTHING- all things that she loves to eat, but some days she strictly refuses to!  I started getting these Plum organics, hoping she would at least get some food into her belly on the days when she seems to refuse everything.  She LOVES these pouches.  And I feel good giving them to her because they are all natural, full of good foods like veggies, fruits, whole grains.  She's getting some food into her belly, in a way that is fun and easy for her to manage on her own.  She is always excited to have a pouch handed to her and will sit to eat the whole thing!

Also, here are my general thoughts on all processed baby food pouches:We go through literally hundreds of baby food pouches (few different brands now) per month due to feeding issues with our child...I would prefer not to use them at all, but he only eats a couple of our homemade ones and until we can get him eating solids, we need to keep using some of these processed food pouches. Out of all the organic brands we've tried, Peter Rabbit has consistently delivered great tasting, nutritious food in high quality pouches. I have only 1 time had defective pouches with foreign objects in the food (something they're currently evaluating to see if it was hard part of an apple or what)...and never any splintering plastic/caps on the pouches, etc. as I have with other brands. However, my one big gripe was that virtually all their flavors had apple as a featured ingredient and more fruit/sugar rather than veggies...I am THRILLED that they introduced this broccoli kale mango variety as well as the raspberry one with more antioxidants. Hoping they make more with veggies and more gluten-free and dairy-free snacks in general. However, a big WARNING and some TIPS for anyone using processed baby food for the kids:1) If pouring food into bowl first (which I recommend), make sure you do the &#34;water test.&#34; I can't tell you the number of times I have put food in a bowl, mixed it up, and everything looked normal. It would be understandable for most parents to give the food to the child at this point. However, I stumbled upon the fact that when I put a little bit of water in the food (because my son doesn't drink much water, I have to put in his food...the thicker the puree, the more water you might need), and began slowly mixing it in, &#34;objects&#34; that don't seem like they should be there suddenly appear. It's like the water thins the food so that any thick food clinging to and concealing the &#34;object&#34; comes loose and the object appears. By object, mostly they are what look to be parts of the food...a long or larger object that could range in color from black to white. From my experience, could be part of the food that shouldn't be there such as part of a seed or more fibrous part of it, burnt material from the heating process, or something else that I can't identify as part of the food and therefore am not comfortable giving to my child. If I find anything, I usually put it in my mouth to determine whether it's hard, part of the food, etc...and if I'm 100% confident it's part of food and safe, I just remove any bits I find in the food. In any case, if your child has a sensitive gag reflex or doesn't do solids yet, it could pose a choking hazard.2) If giving to your child to eat right out of the pouch, make sure you unscrew the cap and evaluate the plastic around the nozzle...I've frequently with other brands seen small plastic pieces splintering off and had small chunks come flying off as I opened them. Also, there's usually a &#34;plug&#34; of darker colored, thicker food toward the top from the heating (to my understanding)...companies have confirmed this is normal and ok to eat, but to me, it's just gross (especially ones like a certain sweet potato/apricot blend where the plug is almost black on certain batches) and I squeeze out this discolored portion.",1,"From someone who goes through hundreds per month",1404950400,"2013-11-08"

"B005MHRB7G","My son LOVED his veggies when he was eating pureed food.  He ate so many veggies his face was orange.  Then at 7 months he decided he no longer wanted to be spoon fed, and we started giving him finger foods, which he took to right away.  And with the purees went the love of veggies.  He suddenly would not touch them.I tried giving him these pouches at 7 months to squeeze into his own mouth, and even tried with the spoon attachments, but he didn't get it.  So for several months we relied on his formula, and then vitamin supplements, to fill the vegetable void.  Now that he is nearly 14 months, I tried these again.  He gets it!  Now he can squeeze the whole thing into his mouth all by himself!While he will eat almost all fruits, he still avoids veggies.  So we buy these again.  I buy the carrot apple, broccoli apple, and spinach pea and pear.  I really would like it if there were more veggies in these, since they are mostly fruit, and he already gobbles that down.  But since beggars can't be choosers, I guess any veggies are better than none.These are expensive and they are not a perfect solution.  I use subscribe and save and get two boxes of 12 per month.  That gives him two per day almost every day.  We still do a multivitamin powder,Rainbow Light NutriStart Multivitamin Dietary Supplement Powder Packets for Children 6 Months to 4 Years, 25 Countand he drinks hemp milk (he is milk, soy, and gluten sensitive).  I hope someday we can stop buying these and he will eat a carrot once in awhile that isn't mixed with apples.

"B005MHRB7G","I love the varieties available, the different fruits and veggie flavors i can let my kid sample, but that's all this is. Almost every single Plum pouch's first ingredient is apple. So yes, you can expose your child to spinach or peas or parsnips to let them experience the flavor, but don't pretend you're feeding them anything other than apple sauce with a bit of whatever's pictured on the front mixed in. None of these are savory, even if they pretend to be mostly vegetables. It's all sweet.In all, it might be a good way to try new flavors, since they're pretty mild given the tiny quantities in comparison with the apple, but if you're using this as a meal, just think how solid a meal it is to tuck into a bowl of pureed apple.",3,"Flavored applesauce",1378944000,"2013-11-08"

It's a shame that people post alarming reviewed without understanding the facts. The pouches are made in China, as are probably 90% of all packaging of of foods you and your family consume. HOWEVER, some important points:(1) The contents (the fruit puree) are made in NORTH AMERICA, from mostly North American produce, but some tropical fruits come from South America(2) The packaging is created in China and is made from 3 layers of material, including aluminum foil and the inner layer is PET (polyethylene) which has been determined safe and is BPA free. The CREATORS of the pouch are a partnership of a Japanese, an Italian and a US company. The just outsource the manufacturing to China. The machine that fuses the pouch together is made in Italy, so it's not like the &#34;evil&#34; Chinese could just switch out the pouch liner for a different chemical based plastic - it wouldn't work in the machinery.(3) The pouches are sterilized during the filling process and the Ph level is maintained below the amount at which microbes can multiply.It is true that China doesn't always have the best food practices, but this food is NOT manufactured in China, just the pouches using non-Chinese technology and machinery.",5,"Yummy yummy! ....oh, and in this case, don't be overly concerned about ""China""",1403568000,"2013-11-08"

"B006JGHMX2","This bar is somewhat akin to being a kind of ~'chocolatized fig newton interior', albeit one in which the fig component is 100% fig (though isn't 'gritty' in places the way the interior of a fig newton is).Just minutes ago, I finished eating my first bar of this.An important distinction to make is that the name of the product (& which is found on the product packaging of each individual bar) states ""Fig Bar with Dark Chocolate"" -- i.e. WITH -- but the Product Description online states ""Fig covered in dark chocolate"" -- which gives the errant impression that this bar is a slab of fig interior, with a dark chocolate exterior, which is NOT the case.The fig & dark chocolate components have been mixed together -- however, when one tastes this, it's almost as though the fig & dark chocolate 'take turns' with your tastebuds -- even though there is definitely an initial fig+dark_chocolate_together overall taste, as I chewed each bite, there was a sort of alternating aspect to which of the components I was tasting in any given split second (somewhat as though hearing a duet being sung by 2 singers, & simultaneously being able to register individual voices & ~'harmonies' [when it comes to the tastes which involve contributions of both the fig & dark chocolate]).It might seem strange to utilize a singing/duet -type analogy, but honestly, I was a bit surprised by how the fig aspect would suddenly 'register' with my tastebuds, & then a split second later, I was 'registering' the dark chocolate, & then a split second later, I was 'registering' both -- it was like different distinct aspects of the respective primary ingredients were still 'standing their ground' despite being part of a mix -- i.e. the 'what makes a fig taste like a fig' aspect wasn't 'crushed' in the process of the smushed figs being mixed with dark chocolate -- & so there's a kind of interestingly multidimensional taste to this.Also, to clarify, the chocolate taste is definitely one of dark chocolate -- i.e. it isn't the 'sweet' taste associated with other kinds of chocolate (it's sweeter than unsweetened chocolate, but this bar would not end up confusing anyone doing a taste test, as to whether it was any kind of 'candy bar' -- this bar tastes like what it's advertised to be -- fig with dark chocolate, period).The ingredient listing on the individual bar's packaging states that these bars are 90% fig & 10% dark chocolate.  The 'how much fig to be mixed with how much dark chocolate' ratio that has been used with the product seems to accomplish what the manufacturer likely set out to do -- i.e. allow the consumer to enjoy *both* tastes, & not have any one taste 'overpower' the other.Texture-wise, this is very much like the Oskri 100% fig bar, but has a slightly more firm texture due to the presence of the dark chocolate.The nutrition profile of a 1.9 oz bar (per what is on an individual bar's packaging) =Calories : 60Total Fat : 2 gSaturated Fat : 1gTrans Fat: 0gCholesterol: 0mgSodium: 0mgTotal Carb : 13gFiber : 2gSugars : 11gProtein : 1gThe ingredient profile =Figs 90%Dark chocolate 10% (sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, natural vanilla)The product packaging conveys that the product is Vegan, Lactose Free, Gluten Free, & Kosher.Consistent with the minimal ingredient mix associated with this bar's composition, one does not taste anything else -- this bar tastes like fig with dark chocolate, & that's it -- no artificial whatnot interfering with the taste or nutrition.Lastly, & this might sound strange, but something I find appealing about the Oskri fig with dark chocolate bar & the Oskri 100% fig bar is that they are an easy, convenient, conveniently sized & indirectly ~portion-controlled, & shelf-life-stable-for-over-a-year (the bar I just ate was manufactured in Feb 2012 & has an expiration date of August 2013) way to obtain (& keep on hand) an atypical ingredient for baking -- or for an ad hoc addition to or topping for various baked goods (& the 100% fig bar, in particular, but also this bar, to an extent [though especially if heated slightly] could be relatively easily spread atop either toast, bagels, or various breads, or various confectionary items [& specifically, those which wouldn't 'fall apart' if something were spread on with slight pressure]).This is an interesting taste, & a not-so-easy-to-find ingredient mix (at least in my experience, & especially in such an unadulterated form [this stuff is 'pure & simple', & without food additives]), & while the manufacturer of the product might not have intended this type of use (as a baked goods add-on/mix-in, or as an alternative to ~jelly or cream cheese), it's something I can't help finding the product readily useful for & utterly compatible with.  And truth be told, after eating one bar, I think I'd actually prefer to have a little something 'with' the fig & dark chocolate -- but I'm glad that the manufacturer didn't include it (or in any way render a new form of fig newton) -- I like the fact that I have the option of pairing this with whatever baked-type base or ~wrap-around form of baked whateverness I so choose...Additionally, given the fig/fruit component, & even with the presence of dark chocolate in this particular bar (versus the Oskri 100% fig bar), the next 'frontier' of food pairing that crosses my mind for these Oskri fig bars, is to try them with pears, &/or blue cheese, &/or proscuitto (& with the 'ultimate' being proscuitto-wrapped figs & blue cheese [I can't help but think that I'll also try it with the dark chocolate-ized version, as well, just to see what it tastes like :) ]).  Basically, anything one might find compatible with figs, I would venture to try with cut up pieces of or a mashed version of an Oskri fig bar (of one kind or the other).  Who knows... this fig with dark chocolate product might end up being a part of my next homerun hors d'oeuvre (I'm already imagining what pieces of it might taste like wrapped in bacon [that possibility has just leapfrogged all others as the gotta-try-it-first pairing :) (& after that, bacon-wrapped fig & dark chocolate with blue cheese)])...I'm glad that this product is available, & look forward to 'experimenting' with whatever add-on/mix-in -type pairings turn out to be a fun & interesting way to enjoy this readily accessible & conveniently mixable/mashable/moldable form of fig.",4,"Fig bar *with*, not 'covered by', dark chocolate.

"B006JGHMX2","First, I want to say that I love these bars. They are delicious in a way that is unique to other treats and they are filling. I can eat one for breakfast and not be hungry for hours.HOWEVER, they are expensive. Now I don't mind paying for an expensive treat given that I am on Weight Watchers and stumbling onto this little gem of a filling treat at 60 calories per bar was like finding a dieters miracle.But for the price, I want to know that what the label says or what the Amazon description says, is, in fact, what I am getting. The labels, last time I ordered these, said, 60 calories, in bold print on the front of each bar. This time it says 150. Additionally, the Amazon description gives two conflicting nutritional explanations right within the same description. One line says ""Fig covered in dark chocolate; Delivering only 60 calories per pack; 2 grams of fiber; 1 gram protein; 2 grams total fat; 11 grams sugar"" while only 4 lines down it says, ""150 Calories per bar, 3 g Fiber; 5g Protein."" This is only the description online, the label itself has a couple more conflicting nutritional facts. The front of the label says, ""150g calories, 2g protein, 5g Fiber, 2g Fat, 26g Sugar."" The back of the label is another story entirely.Again, I love these bars but I pay a lot for them and for Weight Watchers and poorly reported information is derailing my progress and wasting my money and for this reason, I am giving it only 2 stars.Lastly, despite the description, these are not covered in chocolate. They are bars of fig with little bits of dark chocolate within (when you are lucky...often times I've opened bars where the chocolate was omitted.)",2,"Delicious, expensive, nutritionally misleading, poorly described",1336953600,"2013-06-14"

"B006JGHMX2","There was always something intriguing about this brand of snack bars, and the unusual name is part of the mystique. Since I have tastes that are off the well-worn track, I finally took the plunge and tried out the dark chocolate fig bars. And I was delightfully surprised. They remind me of the old ""Apple Bakes"" bars that we used to get at one of those ""Big Lots"" kind of stores, which feature clearance products. So you might not get bowled over by this one's fairly humble presentation, since it seems to have minimal hype. But I really appreciate their simple list of ingredients, and here you get 90% fig in each bar! It's a very dense snack - not unlike a brownie. The box they come in is also a nice touch -- very practical and perfect for hiding!! It looks like they are also made in Wisconsin, so I am glad I am keeping my purchase money fairly local. Plus I have a close relative who lives up there! All in all, this bar (and the other tasty nutrition-savvy ones by the brand) is ""the road less traveled"" but definitely packed with satisfaction. I plan to savor this box for a while and use the rest for gifts.

"B006R7F0PU","With all of the OMG! comments on the Internet, and from the side of the jar, I expected this to be spectacular. Eh. It's ok, but I like Trader Joe's brand much better. Why is this so thick if it has extra oil? TJ's has a very deep, roasted flavor, and it doesn't have any palm oil or sugar, and it's the consistency of almond butter. I'll finish the rest, but won't get it again. I'm glad I got it at W*lm*rt so it wasn't as expensive.",3,"Didn't see Jesus",1400630400,"2013-08-16"

"B006R7F0PU","I have tried many different brands of almond butter and Justin's is by far the most delicious. It is a guilty pleasure because it expensive but is is healthy.

It's so delicious, I hesitate to let anyone know because I don't want to share! My apple becomes an afterthought, a mere delivery system for getting this into my mouth. I think I could literally eat half a jar in one sitting. I just bought my second jar of this at the grocery store, I considered it a splurge because it wasn't on sale either - I just had to have it. Amazon's price is great! Definitely going to plan ahead next time. Enjoy it on fruit, bread, gluten free rice cakes, or a spoon - it's probably even good on ice cream.

My immediate reaction was LOVE and now I require it just about daily! So on my last order, I signed up for subscribe & save on this. I don't want to run out. It's not as smooth as peanut butter, has a little different consistency...but it's not like chunky peanut either.

"B006R7F0PU","It's interesting reading the reviews for different almond butters.  Most say the other brands are too runny/soupy.  This brand is way on the other side of the spectrum.  It's very thick and is almost impossible to spread on soft bread without tearing it.  It's also a bit dry because of this, but some jam or jelly helps.  It's about $5 cheaper at Target.  I highly recommend Trader Joe's almond butter if you have a TJs nearby.  You have to mix it, but it's the closest thing I've found to PB texture.  Plus they have crunchy, smooth, raw and no added salt to choose from.",3,"Too thick and dry",1390262400,"2013-08-16"

"B006U2ZDAE","I LOVE Better Batter's flour so thought I'd try this mix.  I find that the pancakes and biscuits I make using their flour and a recipe from Nicole Hunn's Gluten Free on a Shoestring cookbook are better than the recipes on the box using this mix.  If you haven't tried Better Batter's all-purpose Flour, you are missing out on the best gluten free flour. I can use it in all my recipes and they turn out perfect.",3,"Just ok",1394150400,"2011-04-19"

"B006U2ZDAE","For starters, I'm gluten-soy-dairy-free, and I cook 90% of my food from scratch. I don't eat ready made foods, but with my schedule, I like to cut corners on things like pancakes. Mix + liquid + egg. Bing bang boom done, pancakes in my mouth in no time at all. So far, I've only tried making pancakes with this mix, but the problem I ran into is that the batter never loosened up no matter how much (coconut) milk I added. The directions on the box indicate that 1C of mix should be used, and 1/2 - 1C milk or water. Okay, 1/2 CUP of liquid is not nearly enough to obtain a workable batter. Nor was 1 CUP. At around 2:1 liquid to mix ratio, I gave up trying to thin it out and poured the stiff batter into the pan. Once again, the box says 1 CUP mix will yield 6 pancakes. I was able to get 3, maybe 4, 4-inch pancakes from the batter. They cooked up way too thick, so I ended up throwing them out and using my usual King Arthur flour instead. I noticed that this flour is very dense, so when I try again, I'll use a sifter and try adding 3 CUPS of water to see if I can reach a desirable consistency. As it stands now, this mix ranks at the bottom of GF flours I've used.",2,"Thick Batter",1404259200,"2011-04-19"
"B006U2ZDAE","I am not a cooking type, so I rarely make pancakes from scratch. Krusteaz was the only store-bought mix that worked for the fam, - until the daughter was diagnosed with gluten intolerance. I've tried many recipes and mixes, and didn't like any of them. Then we discovered Better Batter Pancake Mix. Now I have to buy it in bulk because the whole family requests pancakes from this mix. The pancakes are so yummy!! Much tastier than Krusteaz, in my opinion. They are more moist due to the eggs in the recipe. I like it this way. Definitely give the mix a try,",5,"Best pancakes ever!",1390348800,"2011-04-19"

That said there are some carbs I just won't give up, waffles being one. I followed the recipe on the box for waffle mix. It came out a bit thick but the results were delicious. I added a little cinnamon for my tastes. Warning don't mix this unless you will use it within 15 min, per the label, the batter will thicken, rendering it almost useless.

They had an awesome texture...usually my GF biscuits turn out hard and crumbly. The only problem is that they are very very salty! I don't think I'll be making biscuits with this again.

Their cake mixes are probably some of the best I've ever had.  So, even though I have a pancake mix I'm happy with (Bob's Red Mill), I tried this one because I've yet to find a good g/f biscuit mix.  You can make lots of different things with this mix, but I did actually make biscuits with it first.  They were really good!  I was shocked, however, when I glanced at the nutrition facts.  Those four little biscuits I made contained over 2,000mg of sodium!!!  So, if you're going to cook with this, be aware.  I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who's watching their salt intake!",3,"Careful with this one",1357171200,"2011-04-19"

The fact is, when you use quality ingredients, you get a quality product (and yes, quality costs more).

I tasted it and spit it out, too. You know that taste when you eat a green banana?  Bitter, cotton / dry mouth that doesn't go away?  That's what we had. I opened a 2nd pack and it was the same.

I had to add rice cereal to it to make it a little heavy for my baby.

I made every bite of baby food my first two children had, and I was very hesitant to try anything new with this baby. Researching the company and the food, the biggest complaint I found was that they use a lot of apples base in their foods. Frankly, if you have ever made your own babyfood, you know that is one of the best items you can use to sweeten to make it tasty and healthy! So the fact that flavors like pea, spinach and pear have a lot of apple sounds like a good plan to me. Can you figure a better way to get any child to eat spinach! I do the same things from scratch. These are great on the go, and frankly have been wonderful. My forey into purchased babyfood has been successful.

The reason I bought this product was to get more variety--not more apple sauce.

So I made the effort to actually read the ingredient list, and sure enough, apples are the first ingredient listed.  Not berries.  So even though there are berries in this, it is not a berry mix, it is berry infused applesauce, and not at all what I was looking for.  Now I'm really disappointed that I am stuck with five and a half more boxes of this applesauce.

"B00886PPFS","I have two four and 1/2 year old boys and some days I just don't feel like having the eat your vegetable fights.  These ""squeezies"" as we call them, are perfect to get a quick veggie/fruit in for a meal or to use on the go.  My sons would not even attempt to eat a beet - I love them personally and talk them up like they are candy to no avail - but with these, I can give them one and they will eat it within 2 minutes.  For us, they are a quick way to get in a fruit and vegetable and I get no arguments.  We tried the Peter Rabbit version and for some reason they didn't care for them.  We also eat the Carroty Chop and the Blueberry Blitz as well as the yogurt versions.  We still eat our vegetable at every meal, but when we are on the go or in a hurry it is good to have these at hand.  There are no artificial sweeteners and they are only 60 calories per serving.  I've tasted them all and they are all quite good. I don't replace our fruit and vegetable servings with these but use them as an add on or we have them at meal times when we are home late and need a quick nutritional meal or are on the go.  We like them so much we get them as subscribe and save so I don't run out - though we do anyway most months.",5,"My kids love these and I am a fan too.",1349136000,"2013-11-08"

It tastes exactly like regular applesauce, so it must have just a tiny amount other ingredients. The beet and strawberry emblazoned on the package are just there to trick you.Beet juice is actually a coloring agent, but they didn't even use enough to give it a noticeable red color.Please don't buy this.

"B00886PPFS","These have become staples in our house.  I first picked up the ""Blueberry Blitz"" from our local super-market, but the only other flavors they carried were ""fruit-only"".  I really liked the fact that you get at least some veggies in these (albeit a few places down on the ingredient list).  So I came to Amazon and ordered ""Carroty-Chop"" and ""Beetbox Berry"".  So far the kids (boys aged 4 and 6) love them.  They are an easy snack to throw in the lunch box or to take on the road.  I also like that they have a long shelf life and they are certified organic by the Oregon Tilth, one of the more stringent organic certification agencies.Here are the ingredient lists since I don't see them on Amazon:Blue-Berry Blitz: organic apple puree, organic blueberry puree, organic carrot puree, organic purple carrot juice, organic lemon juiceCarroty Chop: organic apple puree, organic carrot puree, organic mango puree, organic orange juice, organic lemon juiceBeetbox Berry: organic apple puree, organic strawberry puree, organic carrot puree, organic beet juice, organic lemon juiceThey are all 60 calories and have 11 grams of sugar.I've also taken to buying the ""Peter Rabbit Organics"" which have more vegetables mixed in with the fruit and are a little larger.  My kids prefer the Mashups, but they also like the Peter Rabbit brand, so I just have a big basket of them all mixed in and I grab what makes sense.  If we've dined out and they didn't get a lot of veggies I give them a ""Peter Rabbit"" for bedtime snack.  If I'm just adding a little something to their lunch box I'll throw in a Mashup.  It does help keep the kids away from the junk food, particularly at snack time.  A great tool in the ""trying to feed the kids healthy stuff"" arsenal.And to be honest I've been known to grab one when I need a quick snack.

"B00886PPFS","I ordered a case of the strawberry lemonade flavor Yogurt Mashups, expecting the same kind of nutritious, organic whole foods that I have come to expect from Plum and other brands of ""squeezies"". I thought one or both of my grandchildren, ages 19 months and 8 months, would enjoy them, and I was especially looking forward to the protein boost of Greek yogurt. After chilling, I opened one and took a tiny sip and was overpowered by the sweetness of it. (Just so you know, I personally use little to no sugar in my own diet, and I CERTAINLY would NOT feed it to my grandchildren.) There are just so many reasons this is wrong! I checked the label and found that these tiny pouches have 14 grams of sugar per serving. WOW! Are you kidding me? Can't we keep the diet pure for our children, at least while they are babies and toddlers?  There will be plenty of time later when you won't have control over what they are served, why get them used to thinking that they need things to be so sugary? I mean, I expected this mix to include some concentrated sweet fruit, like apples, or grape juice in addition to the strawberry and lemon--and, indeed, the second ingredient is naturally sweet banana puree. That is enough! Even eating too much fruit sugar can lead to problems--yeast rash, among others. Please, ""Plum Kids"", help us feed our little ones right!I am going to have to take the time to read more carefully before jumping on the Lighting Deal.

I love that they're clean snacks that are shelf-stable and portable, for the times that a banana might get smooshed in a backpack or they're craving something sweet and fun to eat.Applesauce gets old after a while, though, and it doesn't have much satiety factor to it. I was pleased to discover these mashups with Greek yogurt, as they're more substantial than all-fruit pouches and have a little more dense nutrition. The additional protein makes them a more balanced snack, and my kids really like the taste.I don't personally buy a lot of dairy products for my kids, but when I do I insist they be organic.

These came in so handy when we traveled across continents; they were fantastic on the plane - no messy jars, no spills, and easily resealable. The best part for me is they don't need to be refrigerated before being opened like some of the other baby yogurts. I can just stick them in my pantry. I even took them with me to India. They were a lifesaver on some days when it got too hot for him to eat - I chilled them before I gave them to him and he just gobbled them up. I also like that there is also a good amount of protein in these Greek Yogurt ones and they are a perfect portion size for my little one. I take these with me everywhere - the pouches are so handy. Also, my little one can hold it all by himself and eat/sip/suck it all up without making a mess. Of course, deliberate messes are fair game and when he wants to play with it make a mess, he has fun squirting it out of the pouch and onto his high chair tray.

"B00886PPFS","I gave this 3 stars just based on flavor (I try all of my toddler's food!)  I don't think it's extremely sweet and tastes pretty good.  I'm all about the easy-factor of squeezable pouches for the diaper bag.This can't be extremely healthy for babies, toddlers or kids - however - I realize it's marketed towards kids but there is a lot of sugar to ounce ratio (12 grams per package) and not a lot of protein (only 1 gram).  That's the most disappointing part - quinoa is listed as an ingredient but there MUST be a very small amount of it.  Also very surprised that BUTTER is an ingredient.If you are buying the product based on convenience and organic alone - I would recommend.  In my opinion, children can get a lot more good nutrients from regular oatmeal that you mix w/ quinoa and a few of the other ingredients (apples, raisins, bananas) for flavor - so that is probably what I will do after these packs are gone!",3,"Review of the Morning Mashups Oatmeal Raisin Oatmeal",1395187200,"2013-11-08"

"B008QPAH40","What, a breakfast cookie that is not the size of a dinner plate and easy to chew? And pretty to boot? That's right! If you are not the ""all-natural-rustic-granola-oats-I-love-eating-like-an-equine"" type, then these cookies are for you. When I saw breakfast cookies appear on the market several years ago, I did not covet them because they just looked unappetizing and ungainly. These are light and perfectly rationed. Fast facts: Four cookies to a pack, with five packs in each box. 19 grams of whole grain per serving. No high fructose corn syrup, no hydrogenated oils, and no artificial junk. Has B-vitamins and fiber. Contains wheat and soy. Other flavors: Golden Oat, Apple Cinnamon, Blueberry, and Cinnamon Brown Sugar. O.K., back to me (Amy): So, why only three stars you ask? Well, it comes down to the taste, which, yes, I know, what do you expect with products in the all natural and almost all natural sphere? See below:-Round One: No taste at all, then stalish Oreo cookie flavor was detected.-Round Two: Better this time, no idea why. I was eating two cookies that no one else wanted to consume. They had been stored in a typical, plastic food storage container. Does the taste improve with age and/or unfreshness?-Round Three (11/3/12): Same as Round Two, fresh from packaging.I do love exciting my taste buds, so I am sticking with my rating. I have had the blueberry ones as well, which taste exactly like a blueberry muffin. I did not review those cookies because I had nothing new to add to that scene. A lot of people rave about them. Those berry cookies get five stars in my opinion as well. So, the berry ones are kickin' and these choco ones are adequate, taste-wise.

"B008QPAH40","While the United States seems to have been on a carb-hating craze for a number of years, Nabisco surprisingly comes out with a carb-heavy ""breakfast biscuit"" in several flavors--cinnamon brown sugar, chocolate, blueberry, golden oat and apple cinnamon. Each box contains 5 packages. Each package containes 4 ""biscuits.""WHAT ARE THEY?While the packaging infers that a pack of these cookies...er...biscuits is to be eaten AS breakfast (Nutritious Sustained Energy! boasts the package), the back of the box says ""Enjoy belVita Breakfast biscuits AS PART OF a balanced breakfast."" (Emphasis added by me.) The side of the box suggests eating foods rich in whole grains (such as belVita) along with a piece of fruit and a serving of fat-free or low fat dairy. I personally am not fully satisfied by JUST a package of these biscuits. However, along with a piece of fruit and a glass of milk, I could see them potentially lasting the morning if I was pressed for time.FLAVOR:So far, I have tried the cinnamon brown sugar and chocolate flavors of belVita. The cinnamon brown sugar biscuits are DELICIOUS. I found them reminiscent of Teddy Grahams, a teddy-bear-shaped graham snack I used to buy at the snack back in my office building years ago. The chocolate biscuits are tasty (I dispatched a pack of 4 in a short time) but, as a chocoholic and fan of dark chocolate, they weren't QUITE chocolatey enough for me. While chewing, they give the same sort of mouth feel as the cookie part of an Oreo, but without the dark chocolate punch. I could not discern any ""fake"" or chemical taste in the cinnamon brown sugar, despite the fact that a whole pack only contains 10 grams of sugar (not bad!). I've only had one pack of the chocolate thus far, but I'd say that they don't taste quite as ""real thing"" as the cinnamon brown sugar variety.TEXTURE:Both flavors that I have tried are very easy to bite into...somewhat crisp and somewhat chewy with an oat/grain nubby texture. I found that the chocolate biscuits fell apart way too easily, but that wasn't a problem with the cinnamon brown sugar, which felt heartier to me.NUTRITION:Both types of biscuit contain 8 grams of fat for the entire package, but most of that is good mono- and polyunsaturated fats. Saturated fat ranged from 0.5g (cinnamon) to 1.5g (chocolate). There are NO transfats and both flavors are enhanced with vitamins and minerals. Here are the remaining nutrition facts:Per Pack of Four BiscuitsCalories 230 for both varietiesCholesterol 0mgSodium 180-220mg (chocolate having the least of the two varieties)Potassium 90-190mg (chocolate having the highest)Total Carbs 35g for bothFiber 3g for bothSugars 10-11g (chocolate slightly higher)Protein 4g both varieties.The first ingredient on the chocolate variety is ""whole grain wheat flour"" while the first on the cinnamon is ""whole grain blend (rolled oats, rye flakes).""BOTTOM LINEI would absolutely buy the cinnamon brown sugar again; in fact, I already have!For the chocolate...hmmm...the jury is still out. While I love chocolate a LOT, it really isn't my idea of breakfast food. I was hoping it might stave off chocolate cravings in the afternoon and evening...and maybe it can. Too soon to tell. All I know is that I ate through that first package a LOT faster than I ate the cinnamon brown sugar ones, even though I actually enjoyed the flavor of the cinnamon better. So I fear that they may bring out the chocoholic in me too much.EDITED TO ADD: This morning (the morning after having my first package of chocolate flavored belVita), I had a pretty significant amount of ""intestinal distress."" I do not recall having this problem at all with the brown sugar cinnamon flavor. Perhaps I had TOO much fiber yesterday?

"B008XDLLLS","I've been using this product for a couple of months, and really enjoy it. We have to be very conscious of sodium use at our house, and normally, the way that companies ""trick"" you into low sodium broth is to pump it full of potassium chloride instead, essentially cheating. This is actual low sodium, and the taste is pretty good.However, I've found that sometimes I do need to use a little more than advertised to get the desired taste, and I also tend to need to add some extra spices, namely a Mrs. Dash type product, to help bring out the beef flavor in the product.

Even at the best, this amounts to well less then 50% of Amazon, or their suppliers pricing.I probably woont be buying any of this from Amazon in the future...just make sure I remember to go to Target when the urge hits.My advice is watch carefully, very carefully.",4,"Not Cheap on Amazon",1399766400,"2010-03-19"

"B00ARHGO88","Love love love this stuff.  Some white cheddar popcorns can be too sweet, but this one is more on the salty side.  Plus the ingredients are all natural.  My only &#34;problem&#34; now is where to store 48...make that 47 bags of popcorn.",5,"Delicious",1389916800,"2012-09-18"
"B00ARHGO88","My local grocery store stopped carrying the &#34;SmartFood&#34; white cheddar popcorn so I decided to try this alternative. It has a very similar flavor to the SmartFood popcorn, but seems to have slightly less cheese. This does however bring out the flavor of the popcorn its self a little more which isn't necessarily a bad thing.Overall the flavor was good, the question is simply one of wanting to taste the popcorn more or not. If you would like to taste the popcorn undertones more then pick up the &#34;Popcorn Indiana&#34; white cheddar popcorn, if you don't then go with the smart food. Otherwise they are very similar in flavors and both appear to use a decent quality popcorn.",4,"Very good",1391472000,"2012-09-18"

I stopped trying to get the popcorn because when I follow this link I always get Poppins chips not popcorn. So I guess I won't be getting this popcorn from Amazon anytime soon. Now I'm stuck with over 100 bags of poppins chips and they don't move as fast as the popcorn does.

"B00AX89ODS","I love this stuff and it is very oily, thus it won't dry out like the junk Peanut Butter sold in stores, so you just mix it up and it stays moist until the bottom.  Added flax makes it crunchy.  Very good.UPDATE:  I've gotten heartburn and diarrhea from this product.  I guess it's the molasses (a by-product of the refining of sugarcane, grapes, or sugar beets) or soy they add to it.I'll have to stick with 100% peanuts like Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter.Still, if you aren't allergic to it, it's very good.",5,"Best Tasting Peanut Butter Ever",1389571200,"2012-09-24"

The chemical items (with the exception of one of 2 bottles of Purex fabric softener) were wrapped in plastic bags. Needless to say, the one bottle of Purex that was not sealed in a plastic bag leaked, ruining my value size boxes of cereal & was all over everything else as well. I have issues with paying for return shipping under these circumstances. I am a huge Amazon shopper so really shocked & disappointed when I opened this pkg. And not happy to be out $$ like this.

"B00CA5S4K6","I just found out about these ice chips, so I tried tin of Lemon flavored.  I loved them so much, then, I checked on Amazon and they sold them.  Needless to say, I purchased a variety pack of six fruit flavored tins. These ice chips are recommended for diabetics and anyone with a dry mouth. They are sugar-free, sweetened naturally with Xylitol. They do not promote tooth decay, They actually reduces cavities and plaque. They strengthen tooth enamel and stimulate salivary glands to flow, thus, promoting moisture in your mouth.  My dentist said I had the driest mouth of anyone he had seen because of the medications I'm taking. I keep a water bottle with me at all times, and my mouth stayed dry. My lips would stick to my teeth while talking, and I would bite myself all of the time.  I also would bite my cheeks causing them to bleed.  I'm so thankful I found these ice chips, and now my mouth is so much better, and has moisture flowing. I highly recommend them!  They are very good, and I keep them with me at all times.  Try them, I believe you will like them too.",5,"I loved them so much",1404777600,"2012-10-12"

""We are going to put 2 interesting flavors with our worst tasting flavor to get rid of it"" Variety pack..They should call it what it is... ""Trash Pack""  because they are basically just giving you the trash that nobody wants to buy..A good idea would be to have CUSTOM Variety packs so people can choose what they want..

"B00HKIBDYC","Their rice ramen used to be a wonderful product - I heartily second the previous reviews based on the companies old formula. It now basically turns to rubbery, gooey stuff that is very unappetizing. Several weeks ago, we bought three packages of their millet and brown rice. All three were terrible, so we contacted the company, and they promptly sent us one replacement package, assuring us that they'd had no other complaints. We just bought another two packages, and the first one we tried did exactly what the ones we bought before did. The cake just sits there and will not break up, even with prodding and pulling . It turns into a thicker, stickier noodle than the old formula, and you end up not able to finish the single serving and throwing it away.Please return to your old recipe &#8211; you had a winner.",1,"Bad quality control",1397952000,"2013-11-15"

The last box I received have the date 10/31/16 on the bottom For one thing the noodles look different, more brown. Also they do not break apart in boiling water, even when prodding with a fork as I believe another writer noted. And they do not taste good even if you try to eat the gloppy mess that forms. Something is seriously wrong here. I also note that some of their noodles from 2015 productions were recalled because of mold. What is going on here?

"B00HKIBDYC","First, pay attention when cooking these. Make sure you have enough water and gently work the noodles with chopsticks or whatever to loosen them. Remove them and cool them with cold running water just before they're fully cooked, the carryover heat will finish cooking them.The noodles are springy and chewy and taste like a pretty decent quality eggy ramen noodle.

The water turned to a black sludge that looked disgusting, and which tasted like starch even with the seasoning packet. I might be able to cook the noodles and then drain, rinse, and re-water them, but honestly it's not worth the work. I'll probably just throw out the rest of the box.My advice to skip this stuff and find something else.

It's the one I got and that's what my review reflects.",5,"Great taste & consistency.",1399420800,"2013-11-15"
"B00HKIBDYC","I just got these and quickly discovered that the best way to cook them is to follow the instructions but then to let the noodles sit in the brothe for an extra couple of minutes before eating them. That worked great for me and the noddles were tasty, springy, separated and not sticky or congealed as some of the other reviews mentioned. I love the flavor of the red miso in the soup and it has a nice little kick of spice to it. It is not salty so if you are looking for that Top Ramen flavor you might want to use a packet from those instead of the red miso that comes with it. I really enjoyed the miso though myself. I was so happy to find these because i am diabetic and like to avoid white flour as much as possible plus whole grains like brown rice and millet are so much healthier. these really are terrific and i will absolutely be purchasing regularly.

It's sticky, tough, chewy, and does not break apart in the water even when you yank and tug at the noodles.  Plus there was no seasoning in my package.  Is there supposed to be seasoning?  I'll never buy these again.",1,"It is no good. It's sticky",1404691200,"2013-11-15"
"B00HKIBDYC","When I discovered this gluten free version of ramen, I had to try it. Ramen has been my comfort food for years. Actually, I was skeptical of this ramen but as I cookd them,the noodles were surprisingly good, however soup is so bland and does not blend with the taste of ramen. (Take a lesson from Maruchan, Nisshin). I liked the way the noodles cooked - like all of instant type, you have to cook in rapid boilinb water for a short time.  I put in some Chinese broccoli for greens and an egg&#12288;for a little more protein.  Next time, I think I will buy soup stock from an Asian store and make it with that instead of the packet which, to me, tastes very bland not at all tasty.",2,"Noodle are acceptable, soup packet awful",1404518400,"2013-11-15"
"B00HKIBDYC","Easy to make. Very tasty. Kids seem to like the black noodles. Note that they must be cooked - this isn't instant ramen.",5,"Yummy",1399766400,"2013-11-15"
"B00HMUISSW","If you don't mind losing big, buy now.Go to the Kinnikinnick website and find the item @ $4.99; x 3 = 15 bucks.Where'd the other 45 bucks go? Excelsior? This isn't a Faberge egg...are is someone betting against us?Is this Vegas?  Did I wake up in a bathtub full of ice, naked, with a note stapled to my sternum:""Call a doctor, we stole your kidneys while you were out on rolfies.""If I missed something, I will retract, repent, recant...but I b'lieve this product listing will be in that line, under the banner Scofflaws.",1,"HILARIOUS PRICING!",1395878400,"2012-12-31"
"B00HRIDJL0","This is my new favorite flavor, and they don't sell this flavor in stores near me.  I had 2 or 3 packages broken inside, but not in itty bitty pieces, I could still pick them up!  It's worth it to me to get this many in such a good flavor (even better dipped in coffee) at such a good price.",4,"love this flavor",1397347200,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","All of the packages the biscuits were broken in bits.  Could be the reason that they are sold less as you get the bottom of the batch.",3,"Cracker Bits",1394496000,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","love the product, for a once in awhile grab and go....definitely not &#34;Healthy&#34; but better than a MCD or donut.  My biggest peeve is I cannot believe that I paid as much as I did for these.....buy them somewhere else- less than 1/2 the price elsewhere.  Learn from my mistake!",1,"WAY OVER PRICED",1404777600,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","These biscuits are the perfect amount of food I need when on the go in the morning. They came in good shape, as far as I can tell--not broken up as others have experienced.They are crisp, buttery, not too sweet, and have the perfect amount of cinnamon. I could also see these being crumbled in yogurt with fresh fruit!Although I am not lacking in fiber in my diet, these also have some wholesome form of fiber in the ingredients, which overall, are healthy.",5,"Delicious!",1400284800,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","These are okay, but not nearly as good as the blueberry.  My 14 year old daughter really likes them.  The price was great.",4,"Tastes pretty good",1399939200,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","I love these crackers and it's much easier for me to get them over Amazon prime than a trip to Costco.  I was SORELY disappointed upon opening them to find nothing but, as another reviewer here put it, a box of crumbs.  Unfortunate.  Save your money for a trip to the supermarket.",1,"disappointed, box of crumbs",1402617600,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","These Belvita breakfast/snack biscuits are simply delicious. They remind me of Dutch spekuloos cookies with the cinnamon/brown sugar flavor. I find these satisfying when I have a sweet tooth and need a hearty snack, as well as practical for breakfast on the run -- I throw these in my purse or laptop bag on the way to the office and munch wherever I like. I wish I could put these on subscribe & save!",5,"yummy in my tummy",1397692800,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","I really love this product because I can grab a cup of coffee or milk in the morning and hit the road.  It satisfies my hunger pains.",5,"Tastes great",1394150400,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","I love the ones I buy at the store and  was happy to find them in larger package , what I recieved was a box of crumbs...literally. .not one whole biscuit in the whole box..I wont b ordering more..",1,"very disappointed",1399334400,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","All of the cookies packages inside of the box are just bags of crumbs. If you love whole belVita cookies do NOT buy from Amazon. If you use them as ice cream sprinkles, they are just about right for you.",1,"Love belVita breakfast cookies, unfortunately all I got were crumbs.",1397692800,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","so good and convenient to grab in the morning  ilove the blueberry and apple cinnamon too you will love it",5,"excellent product",1399766400,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","I love belvita, but each package in this bulk box contains cracked and crumbled bits of belvita. What a mess. I was able to eat portions of each package, but wound up throwing away a lot of crumbs. I don't generally have this problem when I buy the smaller boxes at the store.",1,"crumbled bits",1399161600,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","Good tasting but not too sweet!  Perfect for people on the go!  Keeps my blood sugar from dropping and don't  make it rise too much. Learned about them from women in my church.  They love them for breakfast and in between meals.  We are all so busyand this is just the product to buy!",5,"Will re-order soon!",1397520000,"2012-09-24"
"B00HRIDJL0","I love the biscuits, but will never order online again.  Every single package was pulverized into tiny little pieces.  I have to drink them for breakfast.",2,"Pulverized",1397088000,"2012-09-24"
"B00IVT3ZHW","It has been almost impossible to wean ourselves away from sweets but these cookies are vastly better than typical mass-produced cookies.  There is no hydrogenated oil or HFCS and the flours are unbleached. This current fad toward gluten-free for everyone is highly overblown, according to good resources you can check online.  My husband and I follow a rough 90/10 plan as far as using fresh foods as unprocessed as possible.  These are definitely in my 10%!!",5,"love these",1399248000,"2016-04-08"
"B00KRFLDR2","False 24 count, you only get 2 pieces for $0.79. I too thought it was going to be a 24-count, the count is misleading and should be corrected. But I see why they don't correct it the count because they'll never sell them.",3,"24 count",1405468800,"2015-03-21"
"B00KRFLDR2","These snacks are great, but the post is misleading. It says 24 count in the title, but you only get one. Someone needs to fix the title so that it is clear that this is only one snack, not 24!",1,"Misleading title",1405123200,"2015-03-21"
"B00KRFLDR2","These are SOOOOOOOO addicting. I bought these to replace my unhealthy snack cravings (chips and candy). They taste like a bite-sized macaroon with perfect texture and sweetness. Not too sweet, just right and hits the spot. I'm going to try the Classic one now.",5,"They taste like a bite-sized macaroon with perfect texture and sweetness",1405641600,"2015-03-21"
"B00KRFLDR2","I brought these somewhere else, but these are so YUMMY!!!  What a great healthy treat.  Even my Hubby likes them.",5,"YUMMY!!!!",1405382400,"2015-03-21"
"B00KRFLH8C","YUMMY!!!  Great healthy treat!  I do like the ones with the hemp and Chia seeds in them the best.  But, these are yummy also!  Just so you know these are 89 cents a piece on the Nutiva site, so this is a bargain!!!",5,"SO YUMMY!!!",1405382400,"2015-03-21"
